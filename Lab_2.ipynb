She had her small dog with her and was not allowed to enter the tiny shop, but she could see all the pretty choices of the creamy cool confection and happily made her selection from outside the doorway.  They only offer one size, but you can chose up to three flavors.  Sis went for pear, melon, and vanilla. She enjoyed all the flavors and the combo. Melon, in my opinion, was scrumptious. \\n\\n I tend to get overwhelmed when sugar and pretty colors are involved, so it took me a bit to decide. The pomegranite/black currant sorbet was calling out to me, but I wanted something else too. The young chap at the counter, although lacking in the flair and charm that I desire from my cool treat servers, was helpful when I asked for a suggestion to pair with the pom. He said chocolate and I was sold.  The flavors are intense, the combo was right on and you get a lot in the bowl for your 5 bucks.  \\n\\nFor fear of having a bloaty lactose belly, I focused more on the pom/currant sorbet in my bowl and gingerly ate the milky chocolate gelato. But, it all turned out to be too much and I could barely finish half. \\n\\nSister almost finished hers and allowed me to give a few tastes of the vanilla to her small dog. Small dog loved it.\",\n          \"I tried this place at Taste of Cincinnati and it was good.  Decided to check them out now that they are in Central Ohio.  I had my to-go and apparently my order was switched with someone else's because everything was wrong.  My mac + cheese was ham + cheese, and my classic tomato was chunky basil.  They just opened up last week so I guess I understand them royally messing up the order.  The ham + cheese was ok, and the soup wasn't even as good as the boxed soup's you can get from Trader Joe's.  I would recommend this place if you've had a couple and are downtown getting sweaty at the Taste.\",\n          \"The absolute worst Chinese (Americanized) food I have ever had.  My husband and I went to Jade Dragon last night and each ordered the sesame chicken combo.  The egg flour soup came first and it was the consistency of snot and tasted like canned soup.  Then the meal itself.  It was disgusting.  The chicken was coated in a deep-fried batter with sesame seeds in the batter and had what tasted like ketchup for dipping sauce.  The egg roll was really gross and even the pork fried rice tasted strange.  I've never had bad pork fried rice, I didn't even know it was possible.  We didn't eat more than a couple of bites and instead just pushed away our plates and asked for the check.  We ended up going to Linn's China Jade on Cedar Hills and it was great.    Needless to say if we want Chinese food in the Beaverton-Hillsdale area we'll go to Linn's only.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 63119,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Business\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Laurelwood\",\n          \"Austin Eastciders - Barton Springs\",\n          \"Cast Iron\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 965,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"City\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Groveport\",\n          \"Louisville\",\n          \"Watertown\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 161,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"State\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"CO\",\n          \"GA\",\n          \"TX\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Zip\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"30341\",\n          \"02119\",\n          \"02140\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 459,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Business Rating Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.7412825679222,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.5,\n          3.0,\n          2.0\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

She had her small dog with her and was not allowed to enter the tiny shop, but she could see all the pretty choices of the creamy cool confection and happily made her selection from outside the doorway.  They only offer one size, but you can chose up to three flavors.  Sis went for pear, melon, and vanilla. She enjoyed all the flavors and the combo. Melon, in my opinion, was scrumptious. \\n\\n I tend to get overwhelmed when sugar and pretty colors are involved, so it took me a bit to decide. The pomegranite/black currant sorbet was calling out to me, but I wanted something else too. The young chap at the counter, although lacking in the flair and charm that I desire from my cool treat servers, was helpful when I asked for a suggestion to pair with the pom. He said chocolate and I was sold.  The flavors are intense, the combo was right on and you get a lot in the bowl for your 5 bucks.  \\n\\nFor fear of having a bloaty lactose belly, I focused more on the pom/currant sorbet in my bowl and gingerly ate the milky chocolate gelato. But, it all turned out to be too much and I could barely finish half. \\n\\nSister almost finished hers and allowed me to give a few tastes of the vanilla to her small dog. Small dog loved it.\",\n          \"I tried this place at Taste of Cincinnati and it was good.  Decided to check them out now that they are in Central Ohio.  I had my to-go and apparently my order was switched with someone else's because everything was wrong.  My mac + cheese was ham + cheese, and my classic tomato was chunky basil.  They just opened up last week so I guess I understand them royally messing up the order.  The ham + cheese was ok, and the soup wasn't even as good as the boxed soup's you can get from Trader Joe's.  I would recommend this place if you've had a couple and are downtown getting sweaty at the Taste.\",\n          \"The absolute worst Chinese (Americanized) food I have ever had.  My husband and I went to Jade Dragon last night and each ordered the sesame chicken combo.  The egg flour soup came first and it was the consistency of snot and tasted like canned soup.  Then the meal itself.  It was disgusting.  The chicken was coated in a deep-fried batter with sesame seeds in the batter and had what tasted like ketchup for dipping sauce.  The egg roll was really gross and even the pork fried rice tasted strange.  I've never had bad pork fried rice, I didn't even know it was possible.  We didn't eat more than a couple of bites and instead just pushed away our plates and asked for the check.  We ended up going to Linn's China Jade on Cedar Hills and it was great.    Needless to say if we want Chinese food in the Beaverton-Hillsdale area we'll go to Linn's only.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 63119,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Business\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Laurelwood\",\n          \"Austin Eastciders - Barton Springs\",\n          \"Cast Iron\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 965,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"City\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Groveport\",\n          \"Louisville\",\n          \"Watertown\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 161,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"State\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"CO\",\n          \"GA\",\n          \"TX\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Zip\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"30341\",\n          \"02119\",\n          \"02140\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 459,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Business Rating Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.7412825679222,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.5,\n          3.0,\n          2.0\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

She had her small dog with her and was not allowed to enter the tiny shop, but she could see all the pretty choices of the creamy cool confection and happily made her selection from outside the doorway.  They only offer one size, but you can chose up to three flavors.  Sis went for pear, melon, and vanilla. She enjoyed all the flavors and the combo. Melon, in my opinion, was scrumptious. \\n\\n I tend to get overwhelmed when sugar and pretty colors are involved, so it took me a bit to decide. The pomegranite/black currant sorbet was calling out to me, but I wanted something else too. The young chap at the counter, although lacking in the flair and charm that I desire from my cool treat servers, was helpful when I asked for a suggestion to pair with the pom. He said chocolate and I was sold.  The flavors are intense, the combo was right on and you get a lot in the bowl for your 5 bucks.  \\n\\nFor fear of having a bloaty lactose belly, I focused more on the pom/currant sorbet in my bowl and gingerly ate the milky chocolate gelato. But, it all turned out to be too much and I could barely finish half. \\n\\nSister almost finished hers and allowed me to give a few tastes of the vanilla to her small dog. Small dog loved it.\",\n          \"I tried this place at Taste of Cincinnati and it was good.  Decided to check them out now that they are in Central Ohio.  I had my to-go and apparently my order was switched with someone else's because everything was wrong.  My mac + cheese was ham + cheese, and my classic tomato was chunky basil.  They just opened up last week so I guess I understand them royally messing up the order.  The ham + cheese was ok, and the soup wasn't even as good as the boxed soup's you can get from Trader Joe's.  I would recommend this place if you've had a couple and are downtown getting sweaty at the Taste.\",\n          \"The absolute worst Chinese (Americanized) food I have ever had.  My husband and I went to Jade Dragon last night and each ordered the sesame chicken combo.  The egg flour soup came first and it was the consistency of snot and tasted like canned soup.  Then the meal itself.  It was disgusting.  The chicken was coated in a deep-fried batter with sesame seeds in the batter and had what tasted like ketchup for dipping sauce.  The egg roll was really gross and even the pork fried rice tasted strange.  I've never had bad pork fried rice, I didn't even know it was possible.  We didn't eat more than a couple of bites and instead just pushed away our plates and asked for the check.  We ended up going to Linn's China Jade on Cedar Hills and it was great.    Needless to say if we want Chinese food in the Beaverton-Hillsdale area we'll go to Linn's only.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 63119,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Business\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Laurelwood\",\n          \"Austin Eastciders - Barton Springs\",\n          \"Cast Iron\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 965,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"City\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Groveport\",\n          \"Louisville\",\n          \"Watertown\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 161,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"State\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"CO\",\n          \"GA\",\n          \"TX\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Zip\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"30341\",\n          \"02119\",\n          \"02140\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 459,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Business Rating Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.7412825679222,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.5,\n          3.0,\n          2.0\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Can't comment on customer service since I just ordered online for delivery.  I would order again if I'm working in the area again. This Jimmy Johns is the worst that I've been to and I frequent them a lot. The staff are not friendly and the subs are very thin, not worth the money. Food tastes as expected (what you want from a chain). Took close to forty minutes and I was a mile away - not freaky fast. The beach club is my favorite! Awful! I ordered my food at 11:05 and didn't receive it until 1:40. Customer service was awful. The service here was horrible.  Staff is very unfriendly!  I had to tell the girl 3 times before she got my order correct and then she acted like it was my fault.  I will not be coming back.  The jalape\\u00f1o chips are good but their tuna tasted like it died a slow painful death. \\\"Freaky Slow\\\" should be this locations motto. I ordered online and 15 minutes before arriving to the store and when I got here I had to wait another 15. Very poorly managed store, absolutely ridiculous, they even have a huge staff on hand. Ok let's start by say the loud music as if I'm walking into a night club. Then I look at the menu before I get to the cash register and I stand the for a minute before I say something to the guy that is standing there and refuse to face me to take my order WTH. Then he whispers do you want cheese on that and I said yes, come to find out I was charged extra for the cheese. WHAT IS A SANDWICH WITHOUT DARN CHEESE SMH IM DONE WITH PLACE. Now for the group of employees that make the place look like a hang out spot IM DONE DROPPING THE MIC My wife and I are here with out 2 yr old son.  We each ordered a sandwich and began to eat, feeding our son from our own sandwich.  We quickly realised he was only interested in the bread so went up to grab a day old bread for 50 cents. The kind gentlemen behind the counter asked if it was for the little guy and gave it to him for free, asking if we needed any sauces on it for him.  Give the place a shot; what a kind, selfless thing to do! Nice refreshing change of pace from the old fast food burger joints. My wife and I order from here regularly. The app works great for us and the delivery is always really fast.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are always correctly put together and the quality is great. You definitely get what you pay for. \\n\\nAs a suggestion, I always ask them to \\\"take some bread out\\\" when ordering the French bread, it helps to eat the sandwhich without losing the goods. What I don't understand how people manage to hire employees with bad attitudes and let them be the face of a business.3 employees working with no smile, no greeting and bad attitude like someone killed their cat. \\nWalked up to the counter and I get greeted with \\\"whatchu want\\\". Ordered a sub an Asked for a cup of water, got a dreadful reply \\\"we are out of water cups\\\" with absolutely no sense of remorse, let alone a \\\"sorry\\\". It's like I am not giving them business, they are doing me a favor by serving me.\\nIf you hate your jobs so much, don't spoil your customer's mood with bad attitude. Go find another job or leave your f-ing attitude at home. I ordered 2 sandwiches to be delivered. 45 mins later? I'm still waiting. Apparently the B Team is working because it would have absolutely faster to drive there myself, eat, and drive back. If you order delivery...really any time of the day... expect a call telling you they either \\\"don't have bread\\\" or they'll tell you they don't have a delivery driver. Freaky fast delivery? More like freakishly unpredictable and incredibly unreliable/nonexistent delivery. Absolutely obnoxious. Food is always fresh and good, however the service is terrible.  They never get the order right and the employees are rude and not helpful.  The GM is terrible.  AVOID Terrible customer service including the manager. Had a driver yell for not getting a tip, do better the food is still great I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but this jimmy johns not only got our order wrong twice when we were in the store, we realized after we had left that they had forgotten to put meat on two of the sandwiches. The sandwich also left my stomach very unsettled making me think I got a touch of food poisoning too. This jimmy johns needs some serious improvement. I've been here several times, and every time the service has not met Jimmy Johns status. My last visit is what pushed me to write this review and to not return.\\n\\n1. The lady making my sandwich was bossy and yelling at her kids while she was making my sandwich.\\n\\n2. They locked all the doors when they closed in an hour and a half. When I was unlocking the door to leave, the same lady demandingly yelled and told me not to unlock the door. How do you except me to leave? I ignored her and opened it anyway.\\n\\n3. Same lady lied to me. When she handed me my sandwich she said the bread was hard because it just came out of the oven. But it wasn't hot. I'm a professional baker, bread is hard because you burned it or its stale. I wasn't going to complain but don't lie to me. The bread wasn't enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n4. They are slow compared to most Jimmy Johns.\\n\\n\\nDon't yell at me don't lie to me and send your kids home. I'm used to getting fast, friendly service at Jimmy John's. This place was neither of those things. I was the only customer there, so it's not like they were too busy. The lady who was making my sandwich started to make it, and then stopped so she could finish her conversation with I coworker. The sandwich wasn't put together very well. I don't expect to visit this location again. Just like the commercials say, this place is FAST.  By the time I paid and finished putting my change in my wallet they were handing me a sandwich.  I thought they were accidentally handing me someone else's... LOL\\nOn my most recent visit, I ordered The Vito.  It was noticeably fresh with decent flavor, but it could have used a little more meat and liquid (oil, vinegar, mustard, mayo). \\nIf you are pressed for time though as I was on this day, this is your perfect lunch spot. First off customer service definitely lacked. Walking in it looked like they were closed. Crew members were sitting and leaning on tables and loud music was playing. The girl that took my order was slightly rude (making a comment to a sauce I wanted on my sandwich). When wrapping up my order, the same girl that took my order reaches into the pickle jar and takes a pickle with her BARE HANDS. Ew never will I ever come back to this establishment. No one wants to spend money at a place where the employees clearly don't care. This use to be my favorite Jimmy Johns location but the quality of workers has really brought the service down.  My last visit during my transaction the cashier (named Marie ) never spoke or looked at  me once..  I'm not kidding.  I walked in she stood next the register so i started giving my order, she put her hand out for my credit card and gave me a receipt.  I have to find a new favorite location. Walked in the other day. Ordered a sandwich to go. The gentlemen who helped me were very nice and accommodating. It was my first time ever being at a JJ's and they were patient and answered all my questions Sandwich was made fresh. Since I wasn't eating the sandwich right away, I was worried about it getting soggy. Not the case. I ate half and ended saving the other half for even later and it was still fresh! Even though I didn't eat it there, still a clean establishment. I called for a delivery order at 4 pm.  The lady taking my order was more interested in talking to someone else about going on breaks.  She was VERY RUDE to me (as a paying customer) and acting like I was interrupting her.  WTF Jimmy Johns.  I know you are better than this. \\n\\nSOO.... 30 minutes later (when my order should have been delivered) the same rude woman calls me back to let me know their delivery driver will not be in for work until 5 pm.  WHY WASN'T I TOLD THIS WHEN I ORDERED????  She offers no apology or any explanation.  She advises me that I can wait until their driver shows up for work OR I can come pick it up myself.  I cancelled the order. This location will not have my business any longer. \\n\\nThis Jimmy John's is terrible and DOES NOT live up to their company standards.  It's pathetic. Customer service at this location is the worst i have ever expirienced.  \\n\\nI called in an order. I may have as well gone through  a drive through.  You know what happens there.  You get F#@#@ed. \\n\\n I   asked if my special request had been fulfilled and was told  yes.  Upon return to work i found that the request was honored but my order was worng.  \\n\\nWhen i called to complain is when the horrible service began.  That store is run by incompetent extremely rude people.\\nI was  told that there  was no way to speak with the owner of this franchise location.  No response from a call i have in to him either.   I guess the poor service is from top to bottom.   Will never go there again. I didn't get his name, but the guy with dreads fixed my sandwich. His sandwich counter was filthy and he didn't follow any directions on light mayo, light mustard etc. Super fast but that because they barely made the sandwich. Turkey sandwich what could go wrong... let me tell you. \\nI had to search for the lettuce due to such a small amount even a friend asked if I ordered no lettuce. There was more mayo than turkey, I guess 1 slice of turkey is the spec because the whole office enjoyed their bread and mayo experience.  But it was fast.  Increase your quality and not just speed. I called in my order and when I got there girl was cleaning down and never made my food. Took off cleaning glove picked up new glove and made my tuna sandwich. But she was stoned and store smelled like trees, they had the door open. I walked into pot lounge. Never going back Horrible customer service and unprofessional delivery driver. Why would you call a customer to complain about an accidental tip online. You never know what someone has waiting on you IN CASH! Oh and they hang up on you too. Never give this location business. Hopefully they all lose their jobs in the next few months. I think Jimmy John's has a pretty good product. The meat is pretty fresh, as well as the lettuce. Their bread is pretty tasty too. You can expect to pay $7 and change for a sandwich or $11 and change for a combo. If their prices were a tad bit cheaper I'd say it's worth five stars. All in all it's a convenient, healthy option for lunch! Worst seen to date!! Ordered online and the app showed that it was made and out for delivery within 20 min... well, after an hour I called and they said they had to bake the bread and it was cooling and that they would make it in about 10 min. It was finally delivered 1 hr and 40 min after it was ordered. Almost TWO hours for a sandwich!!! WOW... This is the absolute worst Jimmy John's I've ever been to.  They are very slow, customer service is terrible, they can't make a sandwich like you ordered if their life depended on it.  They argue with you if you call them out on their error and insist you are wrong...  Um.... I'm the customer, remember?  I used to go here every week, but I don't think I'll be back unless there's a real turnover in employees.  It's a real shame too. Went to Jimmy Johns after work because nothing else was open for vegans around that area. This was around 9:20p. I got the veggie club. They started making the sandwich and said they were out of tomato. I said \\\"you don't have any at all?\\\". She was like yea but they're in the back and I would have to cut it. (With a attitude) She then looked at the time like I was wasted her time to close and clean up. This staff has always been over it and looked like they don't want to work there. Not surprising really. Giving two stars because she actually cut the tomato for me, attitude and all.\",\n          \"Food was adequate for what it was. My boyfriend ordered a Mojito, they had no mint, said nothing and instead ended up with what tasted like crystal light, vodka and too much lime juice....not terribly interested in returning. This is a dive that I used to go to, but do not anymore because of a proximity factor. As I said it is just a dive to meet and chat, have a drink with friends, and so expectations not being to high, it never really disappoints. Service is kind of lacking sometimes. I was happy with the Nachos. Wish there was more cheese on it. But the guacamole was top notch!\\n\\nHeads UP: They have a 50 cent charge for take out. Cheap drinks, lots of room, realy friendly bar tender, cheap pool, and lots of fun alcoholics. so cute. really close to the max and a great haven to escape from the crazies on skidmore. WTF.... Had to pay for food before even ordered ...Hmmm ever been to burger king if so EAT ThERE service is better and the food with out  a thought 10000 times better.\\nAs for service stay away from the bartender Joe just a wipe we brought my partner's parents here and had the veggie s/m burger with salad. my partner had the eggs benedict, and they shared the french dip with fries. everything was delicious, and the server was so friendly and efficient. love the atmosphere. Went in for lunch during the week and sat in a booth far away from the bar.  I think all the action was at the bar because we never got any service.  When we first sat down someone asked us what we would like and we said we needed a minute. Then no one ever came back.  After a while we just got up and left and ate some place near by because being ignored made us feel awkward and I didn't want to go ask for service and seem rude.  I'm just too passive to eat here. This is my fav lunch and dinner spot. The service is too notch and the food is excellent. There is a new owner who is committed to the bar and her employees. I really appreciate her commitment as a regular. They have switched up the menu and introduced craft cocktails! I recommend coming down to this spot for lunch, dinner or happy hour. I hear the brunch is spot on also I am excited for Pride! The place will be packed! I had no idea this bar was over here. In this side of town you just get used to your usual places unless you live downtown, work there or spend way too much time in bars...no offense...everyone needs hobbies right. I love the decor which seemed pretty butch and no dive bar at all - I was confused as to the reviews mentioning it as a dive since that was not the impression I got at all though I hear they went through a remodel. The staff were amazing and when we went there with a Barfly bus filled with 40 they slammed our drink orders out smoking fast. The drinks were well priced and well made too. Nothing screamed gay bar at all and there was a birthday party happening with catering and everything which was neat - that they can section off parts like that. My boyfriend and I frequent this bar, but not just for the drinks.  We are both big fans of the food.  Attention is paid to the quality of the meals you get and the prices are reasonably low for the the amount they serve you.  The service tends to be kind of spotty, a bit of a hit or miss sort of thing, but there are a few waiters/bartenders that make it all the more worth it to stop in.  It is conveniently located just off the max line and is very easy to find if you know what you are looking for, though we found that we had actually walked by the place several times without even being aware of it's existence.  It is relatively conservative inside on the decor, and not nearly as in-your-face as something like The Eagle, but you still sense a presence of acceptance and tolerance.  It is not uncommon to see men dressed as women at the bar ordering a drink and talking to the bartenders as old friends.  It's a welcoming environment.\\nMy only suggestion for the place would be to hire on a new waiter or two.  There have been several times my boyfriend and I have gone in and had to wait an unusually long time to have our orders taken, or to get our check.  We don't mind too much, especially considering there is typically 1-2 people working as bartenders and doubling as waiters.  It isn't there fault, I just hope that management notices that many of their customers aren't as tolerant to their short-staffed nature as my boyfriend and I are.  \\nAll in all, this place is a good time with great food.  Check it out when you're not in a hurry and ask about the specials-some of them are REALLY great deals.  Cheers! Absolutely HORRIBLE service!!!! Refused to give us water unless we bought alcohol first! Completely outrageous behavior from the bartender, will never go there again. Have never been treated so horribly I've been to Fox & Hounds a handful of times now, and each time it's the same bartender. That's comforting. It's a nice, \\\"old man bar\\\" - but, there aren't a lot of old men here, generally speaking. For a nice, quiet gay bar, I highly suggest this place. If C.C. Slaughters is too loud for you to talk, pop on in to Fox & Hounds and have a few drinks. \\n\\nThey have a pretty extensive menu, as well - including your old standby's of fried bar food. The French Dip is simple but quite good. The Jalapeno Poppers are a favorite. The Chicken Strips and Fries are quite sufficient and tasty. \\n\\nOne pool table, lots of seating, friendly establishment. The location to the dance club of Slaughters night life is perfect. I'd definitely try stopping in and not let previous reviews strip you of the opportunity to support this local establishment. A couple weeks ago, my friend and I went to Fox & Hounds for the Ladies of Rock drag show fundraiser for various charities. We got there super early and the servers were very attentive. My friend and I had just eaten dinner somewhere else and weren't really looking to order anything food/ drink wise, so we tried to stay under the radar with the ordering. Eventually the place filled up and we didn't have to keep saying we were waiting for friends to order. Anyway, I would definitely come here again for another drag show. I'm glad I didn't drink because the unisex bathrooms were kind of gross (why can't boys pee IN the toilet?) and I didn't want to have to go again. That's my only real criticism... I would not waste your time or money at The Fox & Hounds.  I went there with a friend the other night to grab some food and a beer.  The restaurant from the street looked inviting and the atmosphere pleasant.  We sat ourselves, per instruction from the sign in the entrance, and waited for our server.  We waited and waited and waited.  20 minutes later our server, real short hair and balding, pale in complection and rocking 2 tattooed arm sleeves, came over to us and apologized for the wait saying he didn't see us.  I wasn't sure how that could be as we were sitting in direct line of sight.  No problem, I'll take his word for it and let it go.  We got our menus and ordered beers right away.  20 minute wait made us thirsty.  Our server proceeded to take a beverage order for a table of 8 next to us.  Then he shot back up to the bar and began doing I don't know what.  At one point he removed his shirt to expose his white tank-top undershirt.  A little classless but whatever- I'm not judging.  10 minutes later the server came over with drinks in his hands for the table of 8.  That was the last straw for me and we got up and left.  Upon exiting the server asked us \\\"oh, are you guys leaving?\\\" Either he had no clue of his poor customer service on display or he just didn't really want to serve us.  Whatever way you look at it, it was poor poor service.  I wish I could comment on the food but we didn't get that far.  Portland has many, many food options and The F&H is not worth your time! It's not a busy Saturday afternoon but, a lot of dirty tables. Every ketchup bottle was almost empty it took three to get enough for my fries. Plus the bottles were all dirty. Napkins were non existent. No line at the bar but, I had to wait over five minuets to get a Coke while the bartender chatted with his friend. \\nBartender was super nice & food is improved over the old management but, some serious side work etc needs to be taken into consideration. One bus tub and about five minuets would have had the dining room looking neat. I hit Fox's regularly. It's like \\\"Cheers\\\" for the Portland gay crowd.  Food is reasonable and good, drinks are strong, and the atmosphere is warm, inviting, friendly.  Friday happy hour is great. The ambience is Cheers-esque, which happened to be playing on the tv above the bar when I was there for lunch recently. It's neighborhoody. There are regulars. The bartender learns your name. The service is very good--the bartender who is also the waiter during the day is warm without being over the top. He's sincere, low-key, and consistent.\\nThe food is actually pretty good. Some things shine--like their daily soups. The beer and cheese soup that I had was one of the best beer and cheese soups I've ever had. And their grilled cheese is just like mom used to make. On the surface, it's a three star joint. But something about it keeps inviting me back. So I'll throw it another star for that ineffable 'come back' quality. Been to this restaurant before, food and atmosphere were not anything special. Now, on their menu, they are blaming increased prices on new minimum wage laws. I will not in any way support a restaurant that takes worker protections out on their own employees. I feel bad for those people. Your employer is clearly terrible and you should probably seek new employment. Shame on you, Fox and Hounds. I will never return to your establishment and will encourage my friends, family and colleagues to do the same. If you have a problem with local laws, take it out on your legislators, not on your workers and the community. That was nice bar... Good taste ... Meeting friend and drink and eat .. Kind of relaxing place to go there ... The bartender is surprisingly rude & slow despite there being 9 people here not ordering, just listening to shitty 80's music and being old/bitter. \\n10ish minutes after ordering, they told us they didn't have the ingredients for what we ordered, and were uppity when we asked to see the menu again. They messed up my order, and what I got was an over-priced, dried out travesty. And everyone 45+ and/or bitter lesbian/gay got better service than us (young gays), point of order: came in after us, got food before us. That autistic guy isn't lying! And their fugly regulars decided to chime in when my friend had a \\\"difficult\\\" vegetarian order (#SorryNotSorry it's 2015 and you live in Portland). Not coming back. Good food, inexpensive drinks.  The dinner special on Friday was Prime Rib for $12.50!  How could you pass that up?\\n\\nI rarely had to wait at the bar for service, the bartender was friendly. Until last night, I had only been to Fox and Hounds once with a friend for a quick stroll through and once during Pride Week when everyone was drunk and acting crazy. \\nLast night, a friend and I went for happy hour and dinner.  This area of town seems to be really calm and slow until later at night, which is cool, if you just want a relaxed time.  There were maybe two other people when we arrived around 4:30 and then maybe four tables of people when we left.  \\nThe drinks were good and strong.  I had  crispy chicken salad, which was really good.  The chicken wasn't heavily battered and the salad had lots of different veggies.  I forgot to ask for no cheese as I'm trying to avoid dairy and they don't put any on it anyway, so I was happy.  My friend's club sandwich looked really good and he said it was. Prices were very reasonable. \\nThe bartender was low key, not super friendly but mellow.  I'd definitely recommend Fox and Hounds if you just want a mellow drink or meal, I've no idea what the later crowd is like. Well, the decor was beautiful, the food fantastic.  The bar staff was about as friendly and courteous as a plague infected rat.  Go there for the ambiance and the food, but don't except the welcoming committee...it doesn't exist there Small kitchen means you might be waiting for 4 tacos for 50 minutes on a Tuesday... that's with the bar at half capacity. I know there is a new owner and I think she would be best served by simplifying the menu. It is better to do a few things really well, than to do a lot of things slightly better than poorly. It's the only bar open for lunch in the area, they have a real opportunity to be a draw. I'll keep my fingers crossed. Worst experience ever. Just got into town & was looking for a quick meal & drink before a show downtown. This place liked decent and had customers inside, so I entered...I was gonna wet myself as I was finishing my coffee I'd been drinking during the trip so I immediately went into the restroom before making my way toward the bar (a sign in the entryway said \\\"Please seat yourself\\\" and there was no greeter). As I did a gentleman approached & said \\\"Hey man when you came in here you broke about 3 of my rules. You didn't talk to any of us, you had a backpack on, and you have a drink in your hand. Now get your ass out the door now!\\\" I tried explaining that I'd never been there so didn't know about \\\"his rules\\\", nor did I think I had to speak to anyone since the sign said seat yourself. However, anytime I tried to speak he just yelled \\\"Out the door\\\" over & over, louder & louder. Needless to say, I won't be coming here again & neither should you! Rude gay bar. I am straight and don't mind patronizing any business.  They have a beautiful bar and nice happy hour. The bartender, however, made me feel unwelcome. He was talking to other gay customers about an orgy he attended the night before. I really didn't care but decided to leave for a quieter place. After tipping him I turned to leave and he called me breeder.\\n\\nThe food menu is good. Yes, strong drinks, but do I have to deal with a rude waiter? This place should not discriminate against anyone, but I guess my Aspergers is not accepted here. I asked a couple simple questions and received rude responses and then I was targeted to receive my food last and only after I asked where my food was. Then I didn't get my bill when I asked. I won't be back if he is around. Fox and the Hounds has the honor of being my first 1 star review . If you haven't been through the gauntlet to be a regular, or aren't a rude mouthy lesbian, over the age of 40, or a desperate gay alcoholic, no reason to come here, unless you're craving bowling ally food, without the bowling ally. \\nDefinitely NOT a place everyone in the gay community can feel welcome, as a gay 20 something, I was absolutely appalled by the customer service. \\nI'm a hairstylist, so patron interactions are the single most important thing for me when it comes to my dining experience, and this was the worst I've ever had. I killed him with kindness to find the bartender had a headache, and was stressed from calling the cops on a drunk/over served 90 y/o regular.\\n I would give the place 2 stars because he wasn't feeling so great, but I have never been treated so horribly! And then another regular, a large butch women mocked me for my \\\"complicated\\\" order ( a veggie burger with no cheese or mayonnaise) I knew she was a regular because she asked about the bartenders recent vacation. \\nIt's almost laughable! How is this place still in business?! I live on the NW park blocks, and have been looking for a relaxed place to come to that wasn't the atmosphere of C.C's. Unfortunately, the search continues, and I'll make sure to let my friends and clients know where to NOT go for a good time. Wow! What has happened to Fox and Hound? I just went there for dinner, and it was horrible. First the blonde bimbo bartender was too busy talking to the three people that were at the bar but finally I ordered a drink. Told her I'd be at the table and I want to dinner. Literally the cook had to tell her that I was ready to order. I waited and waited for my salad which I asked for no onions. Finally the cook brought out my dinner and I had to tell him what about my salad. I got my salad covered in onions after my dinner was brought out. Got the chicken fried steak dinner it was so salty I could not even finish it. Then I had to go up to the bar to get my bill because she never came back over to the table. And she actually asked me \\\"oh did you have to drinks?\\\" Fox and Hound a hard no. Is this place even a gay establishment anymore? Apparently there is a new owner. She needs to work on customer service and the menu and hiring the right people. I give Fox & Hounds 4 out of 5 stars mainly because of the staff, who are very friendly and accepting of everyone. They make newcomers feel like regulars. \\n\\nIt is primarily a gay bar, but you could bring business clients there for lunch and never know it was a gay bar. Tasteful, conservative decor. Lots of straight people enjoy it as well. A good place to bring mixed sexuality groups, without making anyone feel uncomfortable. \\n\\nIf rated for their food, the score would be one star lower, I'm afraid. They rely too much on frozen, fried food. That having been said, though, their food is better than most bar food, and sometimes they really hit a home style daily special out of the park. And, their hamburgers are very reliable. Not quite gourmet burgers, but better than your average bar fare.\\n\\nThey have a Sunday brunch that is quite good if you arrive early and the food is still fresh. A friend and I stopped at this place today, Sat, Apr 26, '14, at about 3 pm.\\n\\nFood was ok, not great.  Drinks were a bit weak.\\n\\nBut the bartender (slender, about 48-49, short hair) was RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!!  No wonder there were only 3 other people there. came in here to escape the rain. drinks were strong and the bartender was great - good service and friendly. my boyfriend most definitely attracts the gay male population in portland as he got chatted up on the street numerous times, it's almost like we were attracted to this bar by divine intervention ;) I literally couldn't believe it..... Saturday of Portland Pride weekend, the place was packed, and the management had allotted ONE front of the house employee- the bartender!! \\n\\nI will never go back, because of their extremely poor showing on Pride. A gay bar? There's plenty better queer dives in this town. Horrible SERVICE! & Rude.... not personable at all... was frowned at and glared at while ordered food & i brought family in to eat and have a cocktail.. Gurllll.. shameful.. I am very very disappointed in this place! It's in a great location near CC Slaughters so you would think this place would have more business. This place could be great. Sadly the service suck! Specially the old bitch cranky bartender!  What is up with his diva attitude! He's chasing away customers and thanks to him business is going down for them! I would hope the owner would realize this place could be great with out crappy service! Just remember have a bad experience ill tell 10 people, have a great experience I will come back and bring people in! Your move! So my friend and I needed to use a bathroom bad! We popped in here and she went in while I waited my turn, the bartender came over and said \\\"we have 2 more bathrooms in back. He was so friendly we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink. I don't mind that the place was mostly a gay bar, even though we were obviously not. He was really nice and welcoming. I will definitely recommend The Fox and Hounds. Cute place and super chill. love it.  It's your total comfort food place if you ever need one.  It's a great queer place to hang out at as well.  Drinks are made strong, which is good!\\n\\nThe staff was great and the prices were pretty reasonable for the amount of food that you get!  Plus they are open super super late! A very low-key gay bar. Perfect environment for the gay community, but without the extremes. Good food, fair prices. I work right across the street from Fox & Hounds.  During the summer months when I go outside to eat my lunch I always see people from the company I work for go and eat at this establishment.  I often wondered why so many people went over there.  Is it a convenience factor?  Is the food really that good?  What gives?  Well, after all these years of working in this neighborhood I decided it was time to see what the deal was.  I took a colleague of mine out for lunch here and another gem was found.\\n\\nFirst off the food here is very affordable.  Most of their sandwiches are under $8.  This is not an $8 sandwich that you get at some of the sandwich shops in town that come with nothing and you laugh at how small it is.  This is a good sized sandwich that comes with a side (salad, fries, cup of soup?).  My colleague had heard that the Chicken Cordon Bleu ($7.25) sandwich was really good here.  That is what we both ended up ordering.  That and a few drinks (of the non-alcoholic variety as it was a work day) got me out the door for only $21.\\n\\nThe sandwich was very tasty.  The chicken was nice and moist and the bun that came along for the ride lasted throughout that ride.  I wanted to be a good boy and get a salad and was quite happy that it was pretty big.  Very good bang for your buck.\\n\\nFox & Hounds is also a bar that I believe caters mostly to the gay crowd.  Not that you have to be gay to come here.  I imagine it gets pretty lively here at nights and on weekends.  I know it as a place to get a sandwich or a burger that won't break the bank.  Now I know and knowing is half the battle. At first I thought this place looked like a spin off a rustic saloon, but then I realized it was just old and dirty. I've been here a couple times and (I hate to say it) ordered the same thing. Each time it looked completely different. Zero consistency. The bartenders are nice, but they go out for smoke breaks often and one of them had a \\\"shift drink\\\" (or shot, more like) during his shift. I see the potential, but definitely needs work. Good atmosphere and good priced drinks. Solid cheeseburger and french dip. My wife and I didn't even realize it was a gay bar until halfway through our meal. I'd go back for another french dip. It was late on a Friday night.  We were looking for a quiet place for an after-the-show get-together.  One of our friends highly recommended Fox & Hounds, stating something about the bartender always excited to them, so we took the small stroll over.\\nFrom the outside, it looked like the ambiance we were looking for.  Relaxed, pool tables in the corner for casual games, and a bat half filled with patrons.  The transition inside was not what I was expecting, which was the loud music which made things really difficult for me.  Everyone else seemed to be able to communicate just fine over the blaringly obviously iTunes playlist on shuffle that played on the speaker system; for me though, I just gave up taking part of any conversation and just wish the night would end and go home. Used to like this place. New owners, new name. The rainbow flag is gone. Using the restroom requires asking for a key attached to a ridiculously large tchatchke. The tchatchke was disgustingly filthy. Like using the restroom at a Texaco. I ordered the fish and chips. The menu said ling cod. I got frozen Atlantic cod. Major difference. The coleslaw was old enough to vote, it was rotten and translucent. My husband got the Cordon Bleu. He still smells like onions. ONIONS! The fries were ok, large steak fries but the ketchup was obviously married and I didn't want to play shigellosis roulette. A sports themed bar with shitty food is really the last thing Old town/Chinatown needs at this point. Especially one that ignores the neighborhood demographics. Good luck Second Ave Sports Bar, you're gonna need it. Giving this place 5 stars because there is a new owner that is working hard to make things better. It is worth coming down again to check out since I think most people have forgotten about this place. Menu has been slimmed down to a more manageable selection. Food service at this time is still a little slow to get out orders. This is a bit of a problem during the weekday lunch hour since most people downtown are on a schedule and need to get in and out and back to work.  I think after a few of the kinks and growing pains are worked out this will be a downtown hangout worth coming back to. Came in yesterday for a quick drink before catching the train to the airport. Quiet, local gay bar. I encountered a nice bartender who pointed me in the right direction to the train stop, so I'm kind of surprised by the negative Yelp reviews as I didn't experience anything remotely like what I've read. Very fun, good food, casual, just up the street from more touristy places. Friendly crowd and staff. Beautifully remodeled, nice and dimly lit with a warm and cozy atmosphere complemented with friendly and attitudeless service.   I find this place great for relaxing with a beer and a shot after work.  Far cry from yesteryear when the establishment was frequented by loud over weight, unattractive, tweakers/drunks with personalities equal to that of underwatered houseplants.  Good moderately priced menu.  I would frequent this place more often if the pool table was less than seventy-five cents per game......or even  free!! Ate here before and enjoyed it, returned recently and I gotta say putting a sticker on your menu saying \\\"due to mimimum wage increases everything on the menu is +$1\\\" is also saying \\\"I'd literally pay my workers less than this if the government would let me\\\" or \\\"I don't care about my employees, so they won't care about the quality of your food.\\\" \\nNever coming back and advising other to not eat here! This is a quiet, relaxing place.  I like that!  If you're looking for loud music and a raucous atmosphere, this isn't the place for you.  But it's a very pleasant place with reasonable prices on food and drink.  Just one word of advice..  if you order steak or prime rib, ask for it to be cooked rare.  They seem to overcook the beef here until it's dry and tasteless. I have had really bad experience here.. But I am updating my review based on my experience with a bartender named Matt... Really awsome... Visit the ba when he is around! This is a nice place to grab a sandwich and a draft beer. Gay friendly, but not all gay. We went on a monday (yesterday eve). It was Labor Day, not crowded at about 5:30pm. My first time there. I got the rueben sandwich and a salad (instead of fries). Salad was crisp and fresh, rueben was good but note that there is very little meat in the sandwich but it was still ok. It was $8 or $7.something.  A friend got the mac and cheese with bacon. A lot of food and very good, but a tad pricey at $9. The 3rd in our group got the Monday special: a small steak, baked potato, brocolli, and side salad all for $9,50. Very good deal. The service was VERY slow. The bartender was also the server. He was busy talking with the two guys sitting at the bar or going outside to smoke to give us any decent service. But who is in a rush? Glad we weren't. So don't get the rueben til they start putting more meat but the other meals, the atmosphere, all worth it. h and maybe don't go on mondays...get a different server that way. we had a rough week, and had been meaning to come here for some time. we came for lunch 12-22-12. began with a bloody mary, and a corona. next, i chose the veggie s. and m. burger on wheat with a salad and oil/vinegar. my partner had the traditional s. and m. burger with fries. the drinks hit the spot, and the food was delicious. our server/bartender was the best...he was so efficient, funny, friendly, and very customer-focused...we will be back...thx so much... Atmosphere here is great, there is a pool table for those that are interested.  My server was very friendly and funny. My only complaint (which is kinda silly), is the well vodka is foul.  I'm not a picky drinker and order well often, but I ordered a drink and a friend did also, both of us could barely choke it down.  Neither were made incorrectly... they were definitely what we ordered, but the vodka was a little odd... almost bitter.  I can't really fault the establishment though, because you can simply choose another brand of vodka; I would recommend they look into switching that out though and again, I'm really not picky with that stuff.  We will definitely be back! I have gone a couple of time in the past year to Fox & Hounds (little bar/food joint) because it is conveniently located near my job.  It's a dive but I continue to go.  Everytime I go the service is late.  This last time I went is the LAST time I will ever go!!!  Let me break it down for you...\\n\\nI walk in and the waiter (they only have one) looks me directly in the face as I walk myself to a booth.  He continues to take care of the table he is serving at the time.  He walks around the bar and walks behind the bar and gets their drinks ready.  He continues to go back to their table with their drinks and will not look at me...keep in mind I'm right behind him.  He walks back to give the cook their orders and then walks behind the bar to chitchat w/the barflies.  I'm staring him down the WHOLE time.  He then goes and gets their food from the cook area.  At that time I go and get my own menu!  I walk back to my booth and he's right behind me!!!  He serves that last table with their food and goes back behind the bar to chitchat.  Finally...20 minutes later he comes over as if nothing is wrong.  He has stupid smile on his face like he knows he should apologize!!!  But he doesn't!  By this time my date (fiance) had shown up and we order.  By the time we are get our food we eat a couple of bites and have to box it up and leave!  Never once did he apologize or anything.  I have, like I said, been to this place a couple of times and every time I feel like I don't get the service that I deserve!!! Cheap good food.  Besides just being across the street from work, the best part about going there is Jeff, the bartender.  LOVE him.  I've only been there for lunch during work, so I haven't tried any drinks, but the food is good for bar food. DO NOT GO HERE\\n\\n(To the owner, feel free to get in contact with us)\\n\\nseriously we used to be regulars and have gone to this bar for over a DECADE!\\n\\nThis is the last time we will ever go to this bar. \\nYou had many chances and disappointed our group every Sunday for the last couple months.\\n\\nIt's Sunday and we called around 2pm, told them a large group of us will be showing up again. (usually ends up being around 10-15 people, plus others who join us and some who leave during our regular meet-ups) They told us they would be open their POSTED HOURS.\\n\\n(That means you were supposed to be open until 11 every Sunday night)\\n\\n we got there and the lights were off and doors locked, it's now only 6:50pm.\\n\\nThe last time we all tried to meet here, (we meet every Sunday here around 7pm) they told us they were no longer serving food for the day because the grill kept catching fire. (Ok I guess)\\n\\nBut then we ordered fried food and eventually (after three orders of only being able to choose from french fries or tater tots, are you kidding me!?) they told us they were no longer doing fried food either!\\n\\nI'm more then sure at this point, as is the rest of the group, they just didn't want to make food.\\n\\nThey closed an hour and half EARLY last Sunday\\nAn hour early the Sunday prior. \\nAnd many times before that.\\n\\nI work in the service industry, I UNDERSTAND wanting to go home, however I suck it up since I chose the field and job. I work 50/60+ hours a week so I really really understand that. But as a manager who covers shifts and volunteers to close, no matter how slow it might get, I ALWAYS stay open. ALWAYS have everything stocked and KNOW my inventory!\\n\\nIF ITS ON THE MENU,  YOU SERVE IT. PERIOD.\\n\\nDONT LET YOUR KITCHEN STAFF COME UP TO THE FRONT OF THE BAR COMPLAINING THAT SOMEONE GOT THEM SWISHER SWEETS INSTEAD OF SOME OTHER CIGARETTES WHILE CURSING LOUDY IN FRONT OF YOUR GUESTS.\\n\\nHOLY MOLY LADY! GOSH HECKIE YOUR STAFF IS A JOKE. \\n\\nFrom one business owner to another. The biggest regret I had when I bought my restaurant was not letting go of staff members who kept dragging it down and had repeated customer service issues. (Everyone gets a second chance) Eventually I let them go and I actually saw a lot of my regulars returning to me. \\n\\nYou should probably let some people go and start covering shifts yourself. Who knows, you might get customers back. \\n\\nI hope other customers step up and complain so you know what the in the world is going on at your bar.\\n\\nGet your staff and your service back in order.\\n\\nYou have lost a large group of customers and although we will be open to talking about a bunch of issues, we will not be returning to this bar again. That's a minimum of 10+ people your staff has alienated. I always knew Fox & Hounds to be a gay dive bar on the level that the Dirty Duck was, so I never really gave it a chance.  Recently a colleague of mine said she loved to go there after work, which I found odd given how I just described the place.  But yesterday I found myself there for some pool and cheap drinks (Hot Toddies for $5.50) and a friendly crowd.   \\n\\nTo me it still seems apparently gay, but I guess I'm a little more in tune with the cues.  My straight colleagues still enjoy themselves, as it should be.  It doesn't feel divey or dirty at all, probably due to their recent remodel.  I know I'll be back here for drinks with co-workers and some good games of pool. F&H is an unassuming sexless gay bar, where they pour cheap, strong drinks, the regulars are hardcore drinkers and the decor and  lighting are atrocious (akin to a Shari's). Fried food, bad music,  tube TV's and video poker add to the ambiance. \\n\\nIn sum, it's too brightly lit,  the vibe is lackluster, the dicks are limp but the drinks ARE stiff.\\n\\nL'Chaim! I'm feeling nice so giving them three stars because things turned around in the last year for me here. I've often wondered what I need to do in order to get half decent service here. It's taken me nearly five years and they treat me better, but still, worse than Denny's.\\n\\nThanks for having such a big menu, there are some edible things on it, which is more than most gay places in this town. I've got stories though... Moldy fried food, and a taco with a raw corn tortilla? Imagine trying to eat that?\\n\\nI go there because my friends who have been around longer go there and they have more money, flirt with the staff and tip them big. I guess that's how it's done... Echoing what the previous reviewers said...total dive bar.  However,  I had a really great experience there and plan on going back when I come back to Portland.  The staff were all friendly and attentive, my drink did not stay empty long without one of the servers asking if I needed another (yes please!).  The drinks themeselves were strong and cheap (ahhh the way I like em!), the food was decent considering the dive-y-ness of the place, the music was fun and the patrons were also friendly and a lot of fun.  There were four of us in our party, and we escaped with plenty of drinks and nibbles for under $60.00, which was worth an additional star. I have been going to the Fox and Hound for over 20 years and always had a good time and ran into lots of friend.  WHAT HAPPENED!!!  Does not feel like a gay bar anymore and Friday nights are dead!  What happened to our friendly bartender- Joe.  Always had great service and a good time.  The last 2 Fridays were horrible!!!! Don't know if I will go back! I have been to the Fox and Hounds a few times and have never been disappointed. I am not a \\\"sit at the bar type a guy\\\" so all my experience comes from sitting at the normal tables. The food, drinks, and service has always been extremely good. As with any place, challenges do arise. However, the one time that it did, the staff was extremely apologetic and took care of the problem right away. As with all the other reviews, the place is beautiful and very inviting to all. Thank you, Fox and Hounds. I will definitely keep coming back. I went here to meet someone for brunch.  To my surprise it was pretty nice.  I had an omelet and coffee for $8.which is a really low price for what you get.\\n\\nThe waiter was a bit absent minded, but it kind of gave the place character.  \\n\\nThe place is a staple low cost place to eat for the local gay community.\\n\\nThis is located just one block from the Chinatown/downtown stop on the Red or Blue MAX light rail trains. Always a favorite place for a good, solid, simple weekend breakfast without the Portland brunch wait. Excellent service. Generous cocktails. Affordable. And, yes, it's a gay bar but we straights are made perfectly welcome. Super nice people. And yes, you may have to maneuver around a couple of street people, but that's Old Town Portland. All good! When I say we get around.. we get around.. ;) Stopped in here Friday night after we couldn't get into the other place we planned so we had to pass the place we were supposed to go and ended up in this place. Had a few drinks in here, the atmophere was nice and friendly. Had a great time just kicking back and having a few. While I would have liked to go dancing.. thats ok.. I can be just as at home in a place like this if not more. \\n\\nI love pursuing downtown when you don't have a car to worry about.. you just from place to place and then you figure out where to catch the max and go home! So much easier and you frequent lots of bars that way too. Just walk from one to the next.. no problem! Would go in here again. They really do look after thier customers! Fox & Hounds is one of those places that's set off from the main path and once you find it, you're glad it is. The atmosphere is pleasant even when it's filled with regulars. It's a great place to grab a beer or a bite and read a book or just be alone with your thoughts but it's also a great place to gather with friends. \\n\\nService is prompt and efficient and provided by a warm, friendly staff. I've never felt rushed here even when they're visibly busy. You're given the feeling that you are your servers' or bartenders' only customer and these days, that kind of service is a rare find. \\n\\nThe menu is descriptive and offers better than the average bar fare. Try the Mac n Cheese with bacon...creamy goodness served with your choice of soup or salad. Generous portions so anticipate taking half your meal home with you. \\n\\nDrinks are cheap and strong. I know what you're thinking, nuff said! This place sucks. I asked for shots for my friends and was told that the bartender didn't \\\"feel like making shots\\\" so we were only allowed beers. What kind of bar does that? He also told us that if we ended up at his bar, we were probably kicked out of a club nearby. Not true at all for our crew, but I guess that's the type of crowd this bar attracts...\\n\\nNo wonder this bar is huge and only has two people other than us on a Friday night. After my second offensive attempt to have a drink at CC's (see my review), I discovered this gem of a bar.  I can't recommend it enough.\\n\\nNice decor, super bartender's, hot looking AND friendly customers, and an above par drink.\\n\\nWhat more can you ask for? Havent been here in awhile. Found out its under new management. Prices are still low drinks are still good. New menu. New pool tables.Gotta love this place. Like with any gay bar in Portland, don't expect attentiveness on your first few visits - unless you are really cute. Bartenders are efficient, not unfriendly and pour a good drink. The beer taps are probably pretty average for Portland and likely will provide something palatable for discerning beer drinkers. \\n\\nIf you hang around the bar a bit you'll notice that the bartenders and some of the regular customers can get rather catty at times - particularly when the odd unknowing group of apparently straight people walk in the door. This can be off-putting or enjoyable depending on your tastes. However, it all seems pretty harmless and just in fun.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty comprehensive and VERY inexpensive. I have tried a few items on the menu and been impressed with the quality. The cook is really very good.  \\n\\nThe place is comfortable, there are several TVs. Don't expect to catch the latest sporting event though. Fine by me. \\n\\nIt really is a nice place to check out particularly with a group of friends. Grab a table if you are seeking a semi-private conversation. Sit at the bar if you enjoy eaves-dropping on (or participating in) the cattiness. Fox & Hounds has been a starting place, mid-party rehydration station, and last stop to some of my best evenings in Portland.  The place is dark and divy, but the staff are always friendly and cheerful.  They make a STRONG long island which is a necessity on any night out in Portland.  It is within walking distance to events like Blow Pony and places like CC Slaughters and Whiskey Bar.  In the middle of the night when you and your friends need a mini break from the party, another drink, and a clean bathroom, go to Fox & Hounds.  Pull up a chair, share a drink, and get a little quality chat time in with your friends before rejoining the party. If you want a place to dine that is fabulous in all areas, make your way to Fox And Hounds.  Great food and fabulous people. Wow!!!!! I posted some photos of Rick and Jeff. These guys make a restaurant experience memorable  Thanks Rick for the awesome service Can't believe the service tonight.  Girl behind the bar seemed off possibly on something or had been drinking.  It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to to get a drink or bottle of beer. We usually come in on Saturday nights and the bartender who has worked there for years and should be experienced is slow and more interested in idle chit chat than serving customers! Leaving won't be back! First time here, and my last. Sat at the bar, and was forced to witness the drunken owner verbally abuse and humiliate his staff in front of a a bar full of customers. As a customer service business owner myself, I was shocked to see an owner behave this way. I heard from a regular customer seated next to me that this happens often here, and that they can't keep staff as a result. I'm surprised this place hasn't been busted by the OLCC since the owner is drunk while on the premises. The food was good, though, and the staff did their best, given who they have to work for. This place has solid food and the the new owner is proactive to to say the least. and I know they've been going through a lot of changes. I've worked in the industry long enough to know things get weird and unpredictable. It's a good bar don't bitch about food issues. If you can't afford a nice brunch or steak at real restaurant that doesn't those things don't bitch about the BAR you are sitting in. Have a drink chill out...Jim... maybe have a more understanding humble point of view...coming from a church goer.\",\n          \"Beer menu is limited but decent, food items are fresh and delicious. Ambient is comfy and spacious, prices are OK for the area. Great FL Beer selection. Friendly bar service and nice fresh vegetables to go. I like this place a lot! We have had beer so many times from here. But honestly we get wine and charceuterie from la femme de Fromage. Unfortunately they disappointed us so we sat at Florida and co. Wonderful experience with perky staff (Jennifer) and good alternative food option from houndstooth The food is amazing. The drinks are great craft brews and mimosas. The environment is chill and relaxing! Great place Friendly staff, locally grown and produced products, craft beer and even personal hygiene products... What more can you ask for? Cute bar too! Nice little local hotspot inside East End Market just as you enter. The beautiful natural wood counter invites their customers in to their bar stool seating. The staff are welcoming and knowledgeable on their only local ingredients menu. To be honest, we only came for the drinks menu, but they do serve what looks to be delicious food.\\nMy other half ordered their very affordable beer flight, which included 5 beer samples for just $10! I on the other hand orders their Shrub which is a flavored vinegar with sparking wine or water. Let's just say he got the better end of the deal. Even though their options for beer are limited on draft, the options were tasty. As for me, I should've just stuck with me gut and gotten wine. The Bees Knees with sparkling water was boring. It tasted like just like water at first then a sour honey at the end. I gave it another try with their Mayhaw Berry option, which wasn't any better. To tart for my taste unfortunately.\\nNeedless to say I'm sure we will be back for their beer flight again and just avoid the Shrubs and order their food the next go around. Shout out to Florida & Co for repping the sunshine state HARD! From locally sourced ingredients, to brews from all over our lovely state- this spot is showcasing the flavors of all the fun under the Florida sun.\\n\\nDavid was awesome - and helped to prepare a great Beer Flight for me. From stouts to ciders, I got a chance to try 5 different beers. My two favorites were the Apple Cider from Keel and Curly as well as the Key Lime Beer from Key Billy. \\n\\nI also had a chance to try the Shrimp and Grits my momma ordered. This was as hearty as you'd expect a shrimp and grits to be, but not as decadent as your traditional southern preparation. \\n\\nMade with coconut oil instead of butter, the bowl of grits was topped with hearty portions of shrimp, greens, peppers and onions. It was so flavorful and almost too pretty to eat!\\n\\nThis spot has high top tables and a good amount of bar seating, but they'll also bring your food outside if you decide to dine al fresco.\\n\\nThey've also got a good selection of wines - even some wine on tap! They offer flights of wine as well which is fun. We discovered this little gem while waiting to  get into Domu. We took the server's suggestion, ordered a beer off their featured list and got the small plate Red Snapper Ceviche w/ plaintain chips (idk why it says chips, they were delicious, juicy and thick like normal fried plantains). I thought the ceviche was kind of sharp/acidic but my boyfriend loved it. Definitely recommend the ceviche on top of the plaintain to cancel out some of the acidity (even if it is a bit hard to scoop).\\n\\nCant wait to visit again! : ) A place you can buy local groceries and drink local beer and wine too?! What a unique concept!\\n\\nI haven't drank here yet, but I am very familiar with many of the brews they have on tap and sold as bottles. They are all high quality craft beers, all of which look to be brewed right here in Florida. One side of their grocery counter acts as a bar, where about 5 people can sit and enjoy their beer. You'll also see people sitting outside drinking too.\\n\\nSo far I have only bought a dozen eggs here, picked locally, for $4 a dozen. These are the same eggs you might have seen at the Audubon Park Farmers market. Browsing through their selection, they also have all local arugula, lettuces, heirloom tomatoes, squashes, and frozen meats. Plus spices and bottles of vanilla.\\n\\nI'm looking forward to having a cold local beer here one of these days. Went for the first time two days ago and was extremely impressed!  The pesto meatballs over zucchini \\\"pasta\\\" was fabulous as well as the ceviche, which was equally good.  It was great to be able to drink a grapefruit mimosa with fresh grapefruit pulp in it.  Yummy.  The decor and ambiance was steller!  I highly recommend. Great beer election, very helpful staff. They also have a variety of different products ranging from produce to beard cleanser to vanilla extracts. If you are in Orlando, you absolutely must visit the East End Market and stop by Local Roots. Love east end market overall as a whole but the service at Florida & Co beer was not good at all. We sat,  the guy working took several minutes just to greet us and when he did it wasn't friendly..as if we were a bother. There were only 2 other patrons and he engaged them 100% of the time, non-stop talking  about himself and his plans.  Very disappointing as I'm a local and visit this place often. One should engage, conversation with all customers,  be friendly to all. Thankfully there are other great local shops here with excellent customer service! Florida & Co. is the first place (on the left) when you walk in the front entrance at East End Market.  It used to be called Local Roots, but has been going through a branding change.  My husband and I ordered brunch from  Farm Haus (at the back left of East End) and then sauntered over to the bar at Florida & Co.\\n\\nWe were quickly greeted by two staff members that saw us eyeing their draft menu.  They provided recommendations based on the types of beers we like and my husband and I both ended up with drafts that we enjoyed.  The staff said that we could sit at their counter and eat/drink or we could wander around East End Market with our beers, no need to feel stuck there.  As we were waiting on our food to be ready, we took a seat at the bar there, and remained there eating once we got our food.\\n\\nThe offer locally sourced items such as meat, beer, body products, and honey.  Some of the items seemed a bit pricey to me, but others were what I expected at any market or grocery store.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and chatty with those the customers that were also chatty.  Overall, a great first beer at Florida & Co.  I'm sure we will continue to check out what they have on tap during our visits to the Market. This is an awesome place to find Florida local items. I love shopping small and shopping local, and this place kills two birds with one stone, as it were. They have everything from local craft beers to t-shirts that let you showcase your local love with a great shirt!\\n\\nI'll be headed back to snatch up the honey butter in the cold case. Couldn't take it on my last visit since I wasn't headed home, and it needs to be kept cool.\\n\\nThe staff greeted my sister and I right away and offered help on anything we wanted more info on. I also fell in love with the local roots t-shirt that had the Orlando city skyline on it. \\n\\nOverall: A\\nThis place rocks. I love local stuff and this place has it all! Amazing first experience. Ordered the Southern spicy with Florida white shrimp with a soft egg. Was extremely delicious, I was licking the bowl. Had the right balance of citrus and spice! What can I say it was delicious. Located at the front of the East End Market, Local Roots Farm Store offers a nice selection of items. Greens, veggies, farm fresh eggs, meats and nice locally made pantry items like Mannix Vanilla, grits and home and bath products. \\n\\nThe beautiful wood bar offers up a nice spot to enjoy Quantum Leap wines and Florida brewed craft beers. (Including Cask & Larder) Try a flight and sample your way through some great wines or craft brews. Local Roots offers wifi and a spot to sit down to enjoy your delicious sandwich from Hounds Tooth or maybe La Bretxa. Service is attentive and warm, if you prefer to soak up the beautiful Florida day, it's OK to take your glassware outside to the picnic tables or enjoy the courtyard. I love East End Market and Local Roots is one of the tenant merchants that help cement that love! This is the store that helps make EEM a market. I am able to stop by, pick up some bread, local meat, eggs, and a bottle of something fun!\\n\\nAs previous reviews have mentioned, LR has a fabulous wooden counter that you can sit at while sipping on local wine and beer (sometimes they even have rare brews!). I've also sat there having a coffee from Lineage when EEM was fairly empty and they had no problem with this. \\n\\nThey carry various seasonal greens, local organic meat & poultry, eggs ($4/dozen~ I can dig those prices!), locally-made greeting cards, lotions & elixirs, etc. I always get my eggs here now since they are so cheap and who can beat local, free-range eggs? No one. That's who.\\n\\nBut what always keeps me coming back is the service (isn't it  always that?). The person behind the counter is always incredibly nice and always seems genuinely interested in the customer. Last time I was there I bought some eggs, mentioned that they were for my sister's after-wedding brunch, and the woman gushed to my sister and wished her so much happiness and love. It was so nice and more than just a quick 'congrats.' \\n\\ntl;dr - Great eggs, great service = 5 stars Great selection of local and regional beers on tap and they have a sampler platter my favorite! The good service others rave about was absent during my recent weekend morning visit. A buddy and I sat down to eat food from the bakery across the hall - it was already 82 degrees at 11 a.m. and we didn't want to eat outside. \\n\\nThe Local Roots \\\"bartender\\\" said he only had beer and wine. No cold non-alcoholic drinks. He filled a pitcher with warm tap water (no ice), poured us each a glass and then put the pitcher out of reach. We downed the waters quickly - we'd been out biking - and started at our empty glasses while he spent five minutes counting coins in his coin box.\\n\\nNot wanting to be a pain I waited a while before getting up, walking over, and asking for a refill. He obliged - and then put the warm water pitcher out of reach again before walking off to adjust the twine holding the price tag to the kale basket at the back of the store. Same thing again, staring at empty glasses. There were 0-2 other customers in the store this whole time. \\n\\nI understand that we were not paying customers, but the bartender lost a chance to build goodwill and attract a future customer that would evangelize for a business that looks like it needs all the evangelism it can get. What would I have done in his shoes?\\n\\n- Poured the pitcher and then left it for us to \\\"self serve,\\\" freeing him to other duties\\n\\n- Gotten ice for the pitcher without putting the customer in the awkward position of being the 'I am only here drinking free water, and now you're asking me if you should walk across the building on my account for some ice' guy\\n\\n- Poured a couple little taster glasses of beer and slipped them in front of us unbidden. If we turn them down, the bartender just wasted 50 cents of product. If we drink them, he's got customers for life. (\\\"Hey! I'm that bartender's best friend! He just gave me a free beer!) Local Roots, you better clear out a permanent stool at your bar for me. I love your variety of all things Florida. From carrying local beers and wines to handmade hards and deli items. Aside from the eye catching wooden bar, the unique wooden taps truly draw a passerby's attention in. While we were a bit disappointed that we couldn't score a space at the bar to enjoy our Original Sin Pear Cider, we were more than happy to get some vitamin D with our brew at one of the outdoor picnic tables. \\n\\nI could reiterate all the positive things that the reviewers before me touched upon, but what stood out in my mind is the supremely chill vibe given off by the gents running the counter. They were helpful and very efficient despite every seat being taken at the bar. I loved the homemade feeling of everything, like I was welcomed at the counter in their personal kitchen. The chalkboard with the tap listing was a bit small, but it was effective in drawing us up to the counter to take a closer look. \\n\\nI hope I can time my next visit better, so I can pick the brains of the staff and learn more about their business. Those visiting EEM, make this a pitstop on your list whether you're buying a beverage or finding something deliciously local to take home with you. We fancied ourselves a beer while munching on our grilled cheese from La Femme du Fromage (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-femme-du-fromage-orlando?hrid=6G5cYcOnpwibl63Eib6mCA) and Local Roots was able to fill that need. With local beers on tap & the option to get a flight we were able to taste several beers from around the Sunshine State. \\n\\nLoved the wooden bar! Such a cool design. While we didn't purchase anything on this visit, I did love perusing the wares of the shop and thinking about what I might need to pick up next time. If I lived around the corner in the neighborhood, this would be the perfect place to stop to pick up something for dinner. \\n\\nThe gentleman behind the bar was super friendly and didn't rush us in any way even as the crowd started to pick up around lunch time. There's plenty of seating (~15 stools) at the bar so you shouldn't have too hard a time finding a place to sit. Absolutely love this cute and local vendor at East End Market! Florida & Co. serves local craft beers as well as wine and sparkling cocktails. I'm excited to try their food menu next. Apparently you get 25% off your tab when you eat dinner here, even alcohol. Do yourself a favor and try the shrubs. It sounds weird, but they are so good. They are more of an elixir that they mix with sparkling soda or champagne. I loved the hibiscus and Mayhan the best. And if you're looking to try a different wine or beer offered, go for the flights. They are a great deal. You can bring your drinks around the market or even go outside and listen to the live band that might be there. Or just sit at the bar and enjoy some friendly conversation with Emily and Perrin. One of my favorite dishes is shrimp & grits.  The dish as prepared  by Florida & Co offers a delicious healthier option to the traditional southern dish.  Not the less in flavor, it is prepared with coconut oil and adds Swiss chard and kale along with savory shrimp and an egg on top. The ingredients are locally sourced and are fresh   It is a dish worth repeating.  The setting is so nice. You can eat outside or inside at counter seating. They serve wine and also some craft beers on draft. I Can't wait for the next time I'm visiting the area to stop in at East end Market to try it again. Florida & Co is so good it will change your mind about Orlando. It proves it's more than a city just centered around touristy Disney World and full of gross, fried food. WRONG! \\n\\nFlorida & Co is a locally sourced restaurant inside the cool East End Market that prioritizes low sugar foods. On top of that, they sell some of Florida's best craft beer and ciders.\\n\\nI ordered the Mojo bowl or lunch with brown rice, kale, sweet peppers, orange slices, and Florida wild shrimp. It was all steamed and came with a light lime garlic sauce. It was so good, healthy, and balanced the flavors well (the orange slices were perfect and, yes, you are meant to eat the orange peel).\\n\\nThe drink list is really good and they always have a local cider on tap. I ordered the acai cider from Accomplice Brewery and it was one of the best drinks I've ever had.\\n\\nOn top of that, the space is beautiful with a few tables off to the side and a long wood bar to sit at. Also, the service is excellent and friendly! Claim to be a small craft brewery specialist, doesn't even know the difference between white IPA and a pale ale... food is pretty good but owner is incompetent, decent experience but made it hard to enjoy a beer due to bad attitude. Stick too food here This place is a wonderful staple in the East end market. The last few times I've been here have been as a layover type visit- while waiting on a table at Domu or just for cheese (from the fromage) and beer but I need to change that as their menu has expanded and looks rather tasty AND healthy. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the local craft beers they have and are always willing to let you sample something before you decide. The bar front seating can be limited but they are more than willing to let you sit outside with drinks and will deliver food to you outside as well. I came here a few weekends ago with friends and it was so amazing! It's located inside East End Market so a great place to hangout on a Saturday or Sunday morning. They have ample seating space, extremely friendly employees, and a menu full of feel-good, delicious meals and snacks. I ordered the Florida Bowl with Shrimp. It did take a few minutes to prepare, but I was the first customer of the morning and they prepared everything fresh which was nice. The bowl began with a bed of rice, a hearty portion of greens, ample pickled vegetables, and a deliciously light cilantro-lemongrass sauce. Four or five large shrimp adorned the top of the bowl. \\n\\nI absolutely loved this! First of all, it was piping hot and extra comforting on a rainy morning. At $15 a bowl, you really get a perfect sized portion-- enough to feel like you've got your money's worth, but not simply loaded with cheap fillers. The cilantro-lemongrass sauce was truly a standout. A lot of times I order things with sauce on the side because they're too often heavy handed in the application, or way too oily. There was just the right amount of sauce added to this bowl and it wasn't loaded down with weird oils. Absolutely wonderful-- highly recommend! I was really excited to come to this place to try some ceviche. I'm not sure if it was the advertising , but it looks delicious. Surely enough it was. However their is always more then one aspect to a dining experience! Let's take it from the top! \\n\\nI'd like to start with the parking. Which you have to acknowledge as lackluster. It is understandable, for a market that shares space with several different kinds of businesses. However, space is available right outside of East End as it does tend to fill up quickly and for many hours on end. All within a short walking distance and free. No worries! \\n\\nFlorida and Co is located right up front on your left as soon as you enter. The aesthetic immediately captures your attention and if seafood is your thing, then it will also captures your tastebuds. Upon seating ourselves and reviewing the menus. We ordered 2 waters which were filled a quarter full each time (including the one refill). I'm not sure if that is part of the experience or not. No big deal, I finally settled upon ordering the ceviche bowl and anxiously awaited as I contained my growling stomach! \\n\\nMy favorite time arrived as I received my food within minutes and was extremely excited to eat this meal. I went with the jasmine rice option as well and really hoped for a nice heaping bowl of ceviche for $15. To my dismay, I received the bowl, minus the heaping. It turned out to be enough food for about half the actual size of the bowl. In all fairness, the food was absolutely delicious. The fish was very fresh and the acidity and lime really work well together in the ceviche. The onions are proportionate and the jasmine rice is to die for. \\n\\nA restaurant is much more than a food establishment though, it is at its heart. A service based business. I would like to mention Kristen as a very nice and helpful employee. I say this because Kristen turned out to be the only one their that morning who actually put on a nice friendly smile and sought to uphold the customer service standard. Aside from that, I must note that the service in general was bad. After paying for my purchase and putting the tablet on the table for my girlfriend to pay for her meal, the  employee across from us snatched the tablet and gives it to a couple next to me, forcing us to awkwardly wait for someone to check out before us in the middle of us checking out. That was really uncomfortable for me. I still left a tip because I appreciate the hard work small business go through and just want to show my support in anyway possible. \\n\\n\\nOverall, the food is good here. I don't warn anyone against going here. If ceviche or seafood is your thing, you might want to go for it. As for me, Unfortunately, I will not be back, but I do have high hopes for the future of this business! Their food is just amazing. Have you ever had the first bite of something and literally say \\\"OH MY GOD\\\" this is so good and just be in  over it? Lol yeah this places does that to me every time. Everyone who works there is also super nice and helpful. Love love love. If you haven't tried it you MUST! Every time I hit up East End, I always go to Gideon's and Domu. But this time I finally gave the other spots a try, which led me to the zucchini noodle bowl at Florida & Co. they're clearly capitalizing on the fad diets of New Years Resolutions, which is fine by me! The zucchini was crunchy and it soaked up that great pecan pesto sauce. Topped it with their homemade meatballs and red sauce, and I was in heaven. The bowl packed flavor and savor and it satisfied my pasta needs. We came here for another establishment but on our way out of this indoor farmers market type place we made a pit stop. My husband tried a sample of the Central 28, Upriver American Pale Ale 6%. He enjoyed it so much he went ahead and got a glass for $7.00. \\n\\nI will say their beer pairs well with Gideons cookies. 5 Stars for all of the reasons mentioned in my prior review and now some fabulous prepared food!\\n\\nThere's still the local beers, locally made products, and tasty wines, but what was once Local Roots is now Florida & Co., and it provides another great option for prepared food at East End Market.\\n\\nI took a seat at one of their round high top tables and ordered the (local meat) meatball sandwich and a rice bowl of pickled veggies, lettuce, and shrimp. Of course, I forgot to take a picture of the menu, so I don't have the official names of these dishes, but it seems like anything you order off this menu is going to be quality and full of flavor.\\n\\nThe meatball sandwich was hearty and had enough acidity to leave you feeling light afterwards. Which is the first time I can remember feeling that after a meatball sub. The rice bowl had thinly sliced pickled cucumbers, carrots, and beautiful lettuce leaves (I want to say butter lettuce, but I'm not great at identifying greens...). But the star of the dish was the shrimp. There were plenty of perfectly seasoned shrimp (no poop vein!) and a bite of pickled vegetables with shrimp is flavor perfection!\\n\\nService was great (thanks, David!) and the round tables gave more privacy for lunch meetings than when you used to only have the bar as an option. There's not as much selection in terms of produce or local gifts, but that's been replaced with really, really good food. So, overall, a great change!\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1075,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

She had her small dog with her and was not allowed to enter the tiny shop, but she could see all the pretty choices of the creamy cool confection and happily made her selection from outside the doorway.  They only offer one size, but you can chose up to three flavors.  Sis went for pear, melon, and vanilla. She enjoyed all the flavors and the combo. Melon, in my opinion, was scrumptious. \\n\\n I tend to get overwhelmed when sugar and pretty colors are involved, so it took me a bit to decide. The pomegranite/black currant sorbet was calling out to me, but I wanted something else too. The young chap at the counter, although lacking in the flair and charm that I desire from my cool treat servers, was helpful when I asked for a suggestion to pair with the pom. He said chocolate and I was sold.  The flavors are intense, the combo was right on and you get a lot in the bowl for your 5 bucks.  \\n\\nFor fear of having a bloaty lactose belly, I focused more on the pom/currant sorbet in my bowl and gingerly ate the milky chocolate gelato. But, it all turned out to be too much and I could barely finish half. \\n\\nSister almost finished hers and allowed me to give a few tastes of the vanilla to her small dog. Small dog loved it.\",\n          \"I tried this place at Taste of Cincinnati and it was good.  Decided to check them out now that they are in Central Ohio.  I had my to-go and apparently my order was switched with someone else's because everything was wrong.  My mac + cheese was ham + cheese, and my classic tomato was chunky basil.  They just opened up last week so I guess I understand them royally messing up the order.  The ham + cheese was ok, and the soup wasn't even as good as the boxed soup's you can get from Trader Joe's.  I would recommend this place if you've had a couple and are downtown getting sweaty at the Taste.\",\n          \"The absolute worst Chinese (Americanized) food I have ever had.  My husband and I went to Jade Dragon last night and each ordered the sesame chicken combo.  The egg flour soup came first and it was the consistency of snot and tasted like canned soup.  Then the meal itself.  It was disgusting.  The chicken was coated in a deep-fried batter with sesame seeds in the batter and had what tasted like ketchup for dipping sauce.  The egg roll was really gross and even the pork fried rice tasted strange.  I've never had bad pork fried rice, I didn't even know it was possible.  We didn't eat more than a couple of bites and instead just pushed away our plates and asked for the check.  We ended up going to Linn's China Jade on Cedar Hills and it was great.    Needless to say if we want Chinese food in the Beaverton-Hillsdale area we'll go to Linn's only.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 63119,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Business\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Laurelwood\",\n          \"Austin Eastciders - Barton Springs\",\n          \"Cast Iron\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 965,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"City\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Groveport\",\n          \"Louisville\",\n          \"Watertown\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 161,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"State\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"CO\",\n          \"GA\",\n          \"TX\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Zip\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"30341\",\n          \"02119\",\n          \"02140\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 459,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Business Rating Score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.7412825679222,\n        \"min\": 1.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.5,\n          3.0,\n          2.0\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Can't comment on customer service since I just ordered online for delivery.  I would order again if I'm working in the area again. This Jimmy Johns is the worst that I've been to and I frequent them a lot. The staff are not friendly and the subs are very thin, not worth the money. Food tastes as expected (what you want from a chain). Took close to forty minutes and I was a mile away - not freaky fast. The beach club is my favorite! Awful! I ordered my food at 11:05 and didn't receive it until 1:40. Customer service was awful. The service here was horrible.  Staff is very unfriendly!  I had to tell the girl 3 times before she got my order correct and then she acted like it was my fault.  I will not be coming back.  The jalape\\u00f1o chips are good but their tuna tasted like it died a slow painful death. \\\"Freaky Slow\\\" should be this locations motto. I ordered online and 15 minutes before arriving to the store and when I got here I had to wait another 15. Very poorly managed store, absolutely ridiculous, they even have a huge staff on hand. Ok let's start by say the loud music as if I'm walking into a night club. Then I look at the menu before I get to the cash register and I stand the for a minute before I say something to the guy that is standing there and refuse to face me to take my order WTH. Then he whispers do you want cheese on that and I said yes, come to find out I was charged extra for the cheese. WHAT IS A SANDWICH WITHOUT DARN CHEESE SMH IM DONE WITH PLACE. Now for the group of employees that make the place look like a hang out spot IM DONE DROPPING THE MIC My wife and I are here with out 2 yr old son.  We each ordered a sandwich and began to eat, feeding our son from our own sandwich.  We quickly realised he was only interested in the bread so went up to grab a day old bread for 50 cents. The kind gentlemen behind the counter asked if it was for the little guy and gave it to him for free, asking if we needed any sauces on it for him.  Give the place a shot; what a kind, selfless thing to do! Nice refreshing change of pace from the old fast food burger joints. My wife and I order from here regularly. The app works great for us and the delivery is always really fast.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are always correctly put together and the quality is great. You definitely get what you pay for. \\n\\nAs a suggestion, I always ask them to \\\"take some bread out\\\" when ordering the French bread, it helps to eat the sandwhich without losing the goods. What I don't understand how people manage to hire employees with bad attitudes and let them be the face of a business.3 employees working with no smile, no greeting and bad attitude like someone killed their cat. \\nWalked up to the counter and I get greeted with \\\"whatchu want\\\". Ordered a sub an Asked for a cup of water, got a dreadful reply \\\"we are out of water cups\\\" with absolutely no sense of remorse, let alone a \\\"sorry\\\". It's like I am not giving them business, they are doing me a favor by serving me.\\nIf you hate your jobs so much, don't spoil your customer's mood with bad attitude. Go find another job or leave your f-ing attitude at home. I ordered 2 sandwiches to be delivered. 45 mins later? I'm still waiting. Apparently the B Team is working because it would have absolutely faster to drive there myself, eat, and drive back. If you order delivery...really any time of the day... expect a call telling you they either \\\"don't have bread\\\" or they'll tell you they don't have a delivery driver. Freaky fast delivery? More like freakishly unpredictable and incredibly unreliable/nonexistent delivery. Absolutely obnoxious. Food is always fresh and good, however the service is terrible.  They never get the order right and the employees are rude and not helpful.  The GM is terrible.  AVOID Terrible customer service including the manager. Had a driver yell for not getting a tip, do better the food is still great I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but this jimmy johns not only got our order wrong twice when we were in the store, we realized after we had left that they had forgotten to put meat on two of the sandwiches. The sandwich also left my stomach very unsettled making me think I got a touch of food poisoning too. This jimmy johns needs some serious improvement. I've been here several times, and every time the service has not met Jimmy Johns status. My last visit is what pushed me to write this review and to not return.\\n\\n1. The lady making my sandwich was bossy and yelling at her kids while she was making my sandwich.\\n\\n2. They locked all the doors when they closed in an hour and a half. When I was unlocking the door to leave, the same lady demandingly yelled and told me not to unlock the door. How do you except me to leave? I ignored her and opened it anyway.\\n\\n3. Same lady lied to me. When she handed me my sandwich she said the bread was hard because it just came out of the oven. But it wasn't hot. I'm a professional baker, bread is hard because you burned it or its stale. I wasn't going to complain but don't lie to me. The bread wasn't enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n4. They are slow compared to most Jimmy Johns.\\n\\n\\nDon't yell at me don't lie to me and send your kids home. I'm used to getting fast, friendly service at Jimmy John's. This place was neither of those things. I was the only customer there, so it's not like they were too busy. The lady who was making my sandwich started to make it, and then stopped so she could finish her conversation with I coworker. The sandwich wasn't put together very well. I don't expect to visit this location again. Just like the commercials say, this place is FAST.  By the time I paid and finished putting my change in my wallet they were handing me a sandwich.  I thought they were accidentally handing me someone else's... LOL\\nOn my most recent visit, I ordered The Vito.  It was noticeably fresh with decent flavor, but it could have used a little more meat and liquid (oil, vinegar, mustard, mayo). \\nIf you are pressed for time though as I was on this day, this is your perfect lunch spot. First off customer service definitely lacked. Walking in it looked like they were closed. Crew members were sitting and leaning on tables and loud music was playing. The girl that took my order was slightly rude (making a comment to a sauce I wanted on my sandwich). When wrapping up my order, the same girl that took my order reaches into the pickle jar and takes a pickle with her BARE HANDS. Ew never will I ever come back to this establishment. No one wants to spend money at a place where the employees clearly don't care. This use to be my favorite Jimmy Johns location but the quality of workers has really brought the service down.  My last visit during my transaction the cashier (named Marie ) never spoke or looked at  me once..  I'm not kidding.  I walked in she stood next the register so i started giving my order, she put her hand out for my credit card and gave me a receipt.  I have to find a new favorite location. Walked in the other day. Ordered a sandwich to go. The gentlemen who helped me were very nice and accommodating. It was my first time ever being at a JJ's and they were patient and answered all my questions Sandwich was made fresh. Since I wasn't eating the sandwich right away, I was worried about it getting soggy. Not the case. I ate half and ended saving the other half for even later and it was still fresh! Even though I didn't eat it there, still a clean establishment. I called for a delivery order at 4 pm.  The lady taking my order was more interested in talking to someone else about going on breaks.  She was VERY RUDE to me (as a paying customer) and acting like I was interrupting her.  WTF Jimmy Johns.  I know you are better than this. \\n\\nSOO.... 30 minutes later (when my order should have been delivered) the same rude woman calls me back to let me know their delivery driver will not be in for work until 5 pm.  WHY WASN'T I TOLD THIS WHEN I ORDERED????  She offers no apology or any explanation.  She advises me that I can wait until their driver shows up for work OR I can come pick it up myself.  I cancelled the order. This location will not have my business any longer. \\n\\nThis Jimmy John's is terrible and DOES NOT live up to their company standards.  It's pathetic. Customer service at this location is the worst i have ever expirienced.  \\n\\nI called in an order. I may have as well gone through  a drive through.  You know what happens there.  You get F#@#@ed. \\n\\n I   asked if my special request had been fulfilled and was told  yes.  Upon return to work i found that the request was honored but my order was worng.  \\n\\nWhen i called to complain is when the horrible service began.  That store is run by incompetent extremely rude people.\\nI was  told that there  was no way to speak with the owner of this franchise location.  No response from a call i have in to him either.   I guess the poor service is from top to bottom.   Will never go there again. I didn't get his name, but the guy with dreads fixed my sandwich. His sandwich counter was filthy and he didn't follow any directions on light mayo, light mustard etc. Super fast but that because they barely made the sandwich. Turkey sandwich what could go wrong... let me tell you. \\nI had to search for the lettuce due to such a small amount even a friend asked if I ordered no lettuce. There was more mayo than turkey, I guess 1 slice of turkey is the spec because the whole office enjoyed their bread and mayo experience.  But it was fast.  Increase your quality and not just speed. I called in my order and when I got there girl was cleaning down and never made my food. Took off cleaning glove picked up new glove and made my tuna sandwich. But she was stoned and store smelled like trees, they had the door open. I walked into pot lounge. Never going back Horrible customer service and unprofessional delivery driver. Why would you call a customer to complain about an accidental tip online. You never know what someone has waiting on you IN CASH! Oh and they hang up on you too. Never give this location business. Hopefully they all lose their jobs in the next few months. I think Jimmy John's has a pretty good product. The meat is pretty fresh, as well as the lettuce. Their bread is pretty tasty too. You can expect to pay $7 and change for a sandwich or $11 and change for a combo. If their prices were a tad bit cheaper I'd say it's worth five stars. All in all it's a convenient, healthy option for lunch! Worst seen to date!! Ordered online and the app showed that it was made and out for delivery within 20 min... well, after an hour I called and they said they had to bake the bread and it was cooling and that they would make it in about 10 min. It was finally delivered 1 hr and 40 min after it was ordered. Almost TWO hours for a sandwich!!! WOW... This is the absolute worst Jimmy John's I've ever been to.  They are very slow, customer service is terrible, they can't make a sandwich like you ordered if their life depended on it.  They argue with you if you call them out on their error and insist you are wrong...  Um.... I'm the customer, remember?  I used to go here every week, but I don't think I'll be back unless there's a real turnover in employees.  It's a real shame too. Went to Jimmy Johns after work because nothing else was open for vegans around that area. This was around 9:20p. I got the veggie club. They started making the sandwich and said they were out of tomato. I said \\\"you don't have any at all?\\\". She was like yea but they're in the back and I would have to cut it. (With a attitude) She then looked at the time like I was wasted her time to close and clean up. This staff has always been over it and looked like they don't want to work there. Not surprising really. Giving two stars because she actually cut the tomato for me, attitude and all.\",\n          \"Food was adequate for what it was. My boyfriend ordered a Mojito, they had no mint, said nothing and instead ended up with what tasted like crystal light, vodka and too much lime juice....not terribly interested in returning. This is a dive that I used to go to, but do not anymore because of a proximity factor. As I said it is just a dive to meet and chat, have a drink with friends, and so expectations not being to high, it never really disappoints. Service is kind of lacking sometimes. I was happy with the Nachos. Wish there was more cheese on it. But the guacamole was top notch!\\n\\nHeads UP: They have a 50 cent charge for take out. Cheap drinks, lots of room, realy friendly bar tender, cheap pool, and lots of fun alcoholics. so cute. really close to the max and a great haven to escape from the crazies on skidmore. WTF.... Had to pay for food before even ordered ...Hmmm ever been to burger king if so EAT ThERE service is better and the food with out  a thought 10000 times better.\\nAs for service stay away from the bartender Joe just a wipe we brought my partner's parents here and had the veggie s/m burger with salad. my partner had the eggs benedict, and they shared the french dip with fries. everything was delicious, and the server was so friendly and efficient. love the atmosphere. Went in for lunch during the week and sat in a booth far away from the bar.  I think all the action was at the bar because we never got any service.  When we first sat down someone asked us what we would like and we said we needed a minute. Then no one ever came back.  After a while we just got up and left and ate some place near by because being ignored made us feel awkward and I didn't want to go ask for service and seem rude.  I'm just too passive to eat here. This is my fav lunch and dinner spot. The service is too notch and the food is excellent. There is a new owner who is committed to the bar and her employees. I really appreciate her commitment as a regular. They have switched up the menu and introduced craft cocktails! I recommend coming down to this spot for lunch, dinner or happy hour. I hear the brunch is spot on also I am excited for Pride! The place will be packed! I had no idea this bar was over here. In this side of town you just get used to your usual places unless you live downtown, work there or spend way too much time in bars...no offense...everyone needs hobbies right. I love the decor which seemed pretty butch and no dive bar at all - I was confused as to the reviews mentioning it as a dive since that was not the impression I got at all though I hear they went through a remodel. The staff were amazing and when we went there with a Barfly bus filled with 40 they slammed our drink orders out smoking fast. The drinks were well priced and well made too. Nothing screamed gay bar at all and there was a birthday party happening with catering and everything which was neat - that they can section off parts like that. My boyfriend and I frequent this bar, but not just for the drinks.  We are both big fans of the food.  Attention is paid to the quality of the meals you get and the prices are reasonably low for the the amount they serve you.  The service tends to be kind of spotty, a bit of a hit or miss sort of thing, but there are a few waiters/bartenders that make it all the more worth it to stop in.  It is conveniently located just off the max line and is very easy to find if you know what you are looking for, though we found that we had actually walked by the place several times without even being aware of it's existence.  It is relatively conservative inside on the decor, and not nearly as in-your-face as something like The Eagle, but you still sense a presence of acceptance and tolerance.  It is not uncommon to see men dressed as women at the bar ordering a drink and talking to the bartenders as old friends.  It's a welcoming environment.\\nMy only suggestion for the place would be to hire on a new waiter or two.  There have been several times my boyfriend and I have gone in and had to wait an unusually long time to have our orders taken, or to get our check.  We don't mind too much, especially considering there is typically 1-2 people working as bartenders and doubling as waiters.  It isn't there fault, I just hope that management notices that many of their customers aren't as tolerant to their short-staffed nature as my boyfriend and I are.  \\nAll in all, this place is a good time with great food.  Check it out when you're not in a hurry and ask about the specials-some of them are REALLY great deals.  Cheers! Absolutely HORRIBLE service!!!! Refused to give us water unless we bought alcohol first! Completely outrageous behavior from the bartender, will never go there again. Have never been treated so horribly I've been to Fox & Hounds a handful of times now, and each time it's the same bartender. That's comforting. It's a nice, \\\"old man bar\\\" - but, there aren't a lot of old men here, generally speaking. For a nice, quiet gay bar, I highly suggest this place. If C.C. Slaughters is too loud for you to talk, pop on in to Fox & Hounds and have a few drinks. \\n\\nThey have a pretty extensive menu, as well - including your old standby's of fried bar food. The French Dip is simple but quite good. The Jalapeno Poppers are a favorite. The Chicken Strips and Fries are quite sufficient and tasty. \\n\\nOne pool table, lots of seating, friendly establishment. The location to the dance club of Slaughters night life is perfect. I'd definitely try stopping in and not let previous reviews strip you of the opportunity to support this local establishment. A couple weeks ago, my friend and I went to Fox & Hounds for the Ladies of Rock drag show fundraiser for various charities. We got there super early and the servers were very attentive. My friend and I had just eaten dinner somewhere else and weren't really looking to order anything food/ drink wise, so we tried to stay under the radar with the ordering. Eventually the place filled up and we didn't have to keep saying we were waiting for friends to order. Anyway, I would definitely come here again for another drag show. I'm glad I didn't drink because the unisex bathrooms were kind of gross (why can't boys pee IN the toilet?) and I didn't want to have to go again. That's my only real criticism... I would not waste your time or money at The Fox & Hounds.  I went there with a friend the other night to grab some food and a beer.  The restaurant from the street looked inviting and the atmosphere pleasant.  We sat ourselves, per instruction from the sign in the entrance, and waited for our server.  We waited and waited and waited.  20 minutes later our server, real short hair and balding, pale in complection and rocking 2 tattooed arm sleeves, came over to us and apologized for the wait saying he didn't see us.  I wasn't sure how that could be as we were sitting in direct line of sight.  No problem, I'll take his word for it and let it go.  We got our menus and ordered beers right away.  20 minute wait made us thirsty.  Our server proceeded to take a beverage order for a table of 8 next to us.  Then he shot back up to the bar and began doing I don't know what.  At one point he removed his shirt to expose his white tank-top undershirt.  A little classless but whatever- I'm not judging.  10 minutes later the server came over with drinks in his hands for the table of 8.  That was the last straw for me and we got up and left.  Upon exiting the server asked us \\\"oh, are you guys leaving?\\\" Either he had no clue of his poor customer service on display or he just didn't really want to serve us.  Whatever way you look at it, it was poor poor service.  I wish I could comment on the food but we didn't get that far.  Portland has many, many food options and The F&H is not worth your time! It's not a busy Saturday afternoon but, a lot of dirty tables. Every ketchup bottle was almost empty it took three to get enough for my fries. Plus the bottles were all dirty. Napkins were non existent. No line at the bar but, I had to wait over five minuets to get a Coke while the bartender chatted with his friend. \\nBartender was super nice & food is improved over the old management but, some serious side work etc needs to be taken into consideration. One bus tub and about five minuets would have had the dining room looking neat. I hit Fox's regularly. It's like \\\"Cheers\\\" for the Portland gay crowd.  Food is reasonable and good, drinks are strong, and the atmosphere is warm, inviting, friendly.  Friday happy hour is great. The ambience is Cheers-esque, which happened to be playing on the tv above the bar when I was there for lunch recently. It's neighborhoody. There are regulars. The bartender learns your name. The service is very good--the bartender who is also the waiter during the day is warm without being over the top. He's sincere, low-key, and consistent.\\nThe food is actually pretty good. Some things shine--like their daily soups. The beer and cheese soup that I had was one of the best beer and cheese soups I've ever had. And their grilled cheese is just like mom used to make. On the surface, it's a three star joint. But something about it keeps inviting me back. So I'll throw it another star for that ineffable 'come back' quality. Been to this restaurant before, food and atmosphere were not anything special. Now, on their menu, they are blaming increased prices on new minimum wage laws. I will not in any way support a restaurant that takes worker protections out on their own employees. I feel bad for those people. Your employer is clearly terrible and you should probably seek new employment. Shame on you, Fox and Hounds. I will never return to your establishment and will encourage my friends, family and colleagues to do the same. If you have a problem with local laws, take it out on your legislators, not on your workers and the community. That was nice bar... Good taste ... Meeting friend and drink and eat .. Kind of relaxing place to go there ... The bartender is surprisingly rude & slow despite there being 9 people here not ordering, just listening to shitty 80's music and being old/bitter. \\n10ish minutes after ordering, they told us they didn't have the ingredients for what we ordered, and were uppity when we asked to see the menu again. They messed up my order, and what I got was an over-priced, dried out travesty. And everyone 45+ and/or bitter lesbian/gay got better service than us (young gays), point of order: came in after us, got food before us. That autistic guy isn't lying! And their fugly regulars decided to chime in when my friend had a \\\"difficult\\\" vegetarian order (#SorryNotSorry it's 2015 and you live in Portland). Not coming back. Good food, inexpensive drinks.  The dinner special on Friday was Prime Rib for $12.50!  How could you pass that up?\\n\\nI rarely had to wait at the bar for service, the bartender was friendly. Until last night, I had only been to Fox and Hounds once with a friend for a quick stroll through and once during Pride Week when everyone was drunk and acting crazy. \\nLast night, a friend and I went for happy hour and dinner.  This area of town seems to be really calm and slow until later at night, which is cool, if you just want a relaxed time.  There were maybe two other people when we arrived around 4:30 and then maybe four tables of people when we left.  \\nThe drinks were good and strong.  I had  crispy chicken salad, which was really good.  The chicken wasn't heavily battered and the salad had lots of different veggies.  I forgot to ask for no cheese as I'm trying to avoid dairy and they don't put any on it anyway, so I was happy.  My friend's club sandwich looked really good and he said it was. Prices were very reasonable. \\nThe bartender was low key, not super friendly but mellow.  I'd definitely recommend Fox and Hounds if you just want a mellow drink or meal, I've no idea what the later crowd is like. Well, the decor was beautiful, the food fantastic.  The bar staff was about as friendly and courteous as a plague infected rat.  Go there for the ambiance and the food, but don't except the welcoming committee...it doesn't exist there Small kitchen means you might be waiting for 4 tacos for 50 minutes on a Tuesday... that's with the bar at half capacity. I know there is a new owner and I think she would be best served by simplifying the menu. It is better to do a few things really well, than to do a lot of things slightly better than poorly. It's the only bar open for lunch in the area, they have a real opportunity to be a draw. I'll keep my fingers crossed. Worst experience ever. Just got into town & was looking for a quick meal & drink before a show downtown. This place liked decent and had customers inside, so I entered...I was gonna wet myself as I was finishing my coffee I'd been drinking during the trip so I immediately went into the restroom before making my way toward the bar (a sign in the entryway said \\\"Please seat yourself\\\" and there was no greeter). As I did a gentleman approached & said \\\"Hey man when you came in here you broke about 3 of my rules. You didn't talk to any of us, you had a backpack on, and you have a drink in your hand. Now get your ass out the door now!\\\" I tried explaining that I'd never been there so didn't know about \\\"his rules\\\", nor did I think I had to speak to anyone since the sign said seat yourself. However, anytime I tried to speak he just yelled \\\"Out the door\\\" over & over, louder & louder. Needless to say, I won't be coming here again & neither should you! Rude gay bar. I am straight and don't mind patronizing any business.  They have a beautiful bar and nice happy hour. The bartender, however, made me feel unwelcome. He was talking to other gay customers about an orgy he attended the night before. I really didn't care but decided to leave for a quieter place. After tipping him I turned to leave and he called me breeder.\\n\\nThe food menu is good. Yes, strong drinks, but do I have to deal with a rude waiter? This place should not discriminate against anyone, but I guess my Aspergers is not accepted here. I asked a couple simple questions and received rude responses and then I was targeted to receive my food last and only after I asked where my food was. Then I didn't get my bill when I asked. I won't be back if he is around. Fox and the Hounds has the honor of being my first 1 star review . If you haven't been through the gauntlet to be a regular, or aren't a rude mouthy lesbian, over the age of 40, or a desperate gay alcoholic, no reason to come here, unless you're craving bowling ally food, without the bowling ally. \\nDefinitely NOT a place everyone in the gay community can feel welcome, as a gay 20 something, I was absolutely appalled by the customer service. \\nI'm a hairstylist, so patron interactions are the single most important thing for me when it comes to my dining experience, and this was the worst I've ever had. I killed him with kindness to find the bartender had a headache, and was stressed from calling the cops on a drunk/over served 90 y/o regular.\\n I would give the place 2 stars because he wasn't feeling so great, but I have never been treated so horribly! And then another regular, a large butch women mocked me for my \\\"complicated\\\" order ( a veggie burger with no cheese or mayonnaise) I knew she was a regular because she asked about the bartenders recent vacation. \\nIt's almost laughable! How is this place still in business?! I live on the NW park blocks, and have been looking for a relaxed place to come to that wasn't the atmosphere of C.C's. Unfortunately, the search continues, and I'll make sure to let my friends and clients know where to NOT go for a good time. Wow! What has happened to Fox and Hound? I just went there for dinner, and it was horrible. First the blonde bimbo bartender was too busy talking to the three people that were at the bar but finally I ordered a drink. Told her I'd be at the table and I want to dinner. Literally the cook had to tell her that I was ready to order. I waited and waited for my salad which I asked for no onions. Finally the cook brought out my dinner and I had to tell him what about my salad. I got my salad covered in onions after my dinner was brought out. Got the chicken fried steak dinner it was so salty I could not even finish it. Then I had to go up to the bar to get my bill because she never came back over to the table. And she actually asked me \\\"oh did you have to drinks?\\\" Fox and Hound a hard no. Is this place even a gay establishment anymore? Apparently there is a new owner. She needs to work on customer service and the menu and hiring the right people. I give Fox & Hounds 4 out of 5 stars mainly because of the staff, who are very friendly and accepting of everyone. They make newcomers feel like regulars. \\n\\nIt is primarily a gay bar, but you could bring business clients there for lunch and never know it was a gay bar. Tasteful, conservative decor. Lots of straight people enjoy it as well. A good place to bring mixed sexuality groups, without making anyone feel uncomfortable. \\n\\nIf rated for their food, the score would be one star lower, I'm afraid. They rely too much on frozen, fried food. That having been said, though, their food is better than most bar food, and sometimes they really hit a home style daily special out of the park. And, their hamburgers are very reliable. Not quite gourmet burgers, but better than your average bar fare.\\n\\nThey have a Sunday brunch that is quite good if you arrive early and the food is still fresh. A friend and I stopped at this place today, Sat, Apr 26, '14, at about 3 pm.\\n\\nFood was ok, not great.  Drinks were a bit weak.\\n\\nBut the bartender (slender, about 48-49, short hair) was RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!!  No wonder there were only 3 other people there. came in here to escape the rain. drinks were strong and the bartender was great - good service and friendly. my boyfriend most definitely attracts the gay male population in portland as he got chatted up on the street numerous times, it's almost like we were attracted to this bar by divine intervention ;) I literally couldn't believe it..... Saturday of Portland Pride weekend, the place was packed, and the management had allotted ONE front of the house employee- the bartender!! \\n\\nI will never go back, because of their extremely poor showing on Pride. A gay bar? There's plenty better queer dives in this town. Horrible SERVICE! & Rude.... not personable at all... was frowned at and glared at while ordered food & i brought family in to eat and have a cocktail.. Gurllll.. shameful.. I am very very disappointed in this place! It's in a great location near CC Slaughters so you would think this place would have more business. This place could be great. Sadly the service suck! Specially the old bitch cranky bartender!  What is up with his diva attitude! He's chasing away customers and thanks to him business is going down for them! I would hope the owner would realize this place could be great with out crappy service! Just remember have a bad experience ill tell 10 people, have a great experience I will come back and bring people in! Your move! So my friend and I needed to use a bathroom bad! We popped in here and she went in while I waited my turn, the bartender came over and said \\\"we have 2 more bathrooms in back. He was so friendly we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink. I don't mind that the place was mostly a gay bar, even though we were obviously not. He was really nice and welcoming. I will definitely recommend The Fox and Hounds. Cute place and super chill. love it.  It's your total comfort food place if you ever need one.  It's a great queer place to hang out at as well.  Drinks are made strong, which is good!\\n\\nThe staff was great and the prices were pretty reasonable for the amount of food that you get!  Plus they are open super super late! A very low-key gay bar. Perfect environment for the gay community, but without the extremes. Good food, fair prices. I work right across the street from Fox & Hounds.  During the summer months when I go outside to eat my lunch I always see people from the company I work for go and eat at this establishment.  I often wondered why so many people went over there.  Is it a convenience factor?  Is the food really that good?  What gives?  Well, after all these years of working in this neighborhood I decided it was time to see what the deal was.  I took a colleague of mine out for lunch here and another gem was found.\\n\\nFirst off the food here is very affordable.  Most of their sandwiches are under $8.  This is not an $8 sandwich that you get at some of the sandwich shops in town that come with nothing and you laugh at how small it is.  This is a good sized sandwich that comes with a side (salad, fries, cup of soup?).  My colleague had heard that the Chicken Cordon Bleu ($7.25) sandwich was really good here.  That is what we both ended up ordering.  That and a few drinks (of the non-alcoholic variety as it was a work day) got me out the door for only $21.\\n\\nThe sandwich was very tasty.  The chicken was nice and moist and the bun that came along for the ride lasted throughout that ride.  I wanted to be a good boy and get a salad and was quite happy that it was pretty big.  Very good bang for your buck.\\n\\nFox & Hounds is also a bar that I believe caters mostly to the gay crowd.  Not that you have to be gay to come here.  I imagine it gets pretty lively here at nights and on weekends.  I know it as a place to get a sandwich or a burger that won't break the bank.  Now I know and knowing is half the battle. At first I thought this place looked like a spin off a rustic saloon, but then I realized it was just old and dirty. I've been here a couple times and (I hate to say it) ordered the same thing. Each time it looked completely different. Zero consistency. The bartenders are nice, but they go out for smoke breaks often and one of them had a \\\"shift drink\\\" (or shot, more like) during his shift. I see the potential, but definitely needs work. Good atmosphere and good priced drinks. Solid cheeseburger and french dip. My wife and I didn't even realize it was a gay bar until halfway through our meal. I'd go back for another french dip. It was late on a Friday night.  We were looking for a quiet place for an after-the-show get-together.  One of our friends highly recommended Fox & Hounds, stating something about the bartender always excited to them, so we took the small stroll over.\\nFrom the outside, it looked like the ambiance we were looking for.  Relaxed, pool tables in the corner for casual games, and a bat half filled with patrons.  The transition inside was not what I was expecting, which was the loud music which made things really difficult for me.  Everyone else seemed to be able to communicate just fine over the blaringly obviously iTunes playlist on shuffle that played on the speaker system; for me though, I just gave up taking part of any conversation and just wish the night would end and go home. Used to like this place. New owners, new name. The rainbow flag is gone. Using the restroom requires asking for a key attached to a ridiculously large tchatchke. The tchatchke was disgustingly filthy. Like using the restroom at a Texaco. I ordered the fish and chips. The menu said ling cod. I got frozen Atlantic cod. Major difference. The coleslaw was old enough to vote, it was rotten and translucent. My husband got the Cordon Bleu. He still smells like onions. ONIONS! The fries were ok, large steak fries but the ketchup was obviously married and I didn't want to play shigellosis roulette. A sports themed bar with shitty food is really the last thing Old town/Chinatown needs at this point. Especially one that ignores the neighborhood demographics. Good luck Second Ave Sports Bar, you're gonna need it. Giving this place 5 stars because there is a new owner that is working hard to make things better. It is worth coming down again to check out since I think most people have forgotten about this place. Menu has been slimmed down to a more manageable selection. Food service at this time is still a little slow to get out orders. This is a bit of a problem during the weekday lunch hour since most people downtown are on a schedule and need to get in and out and back to work.  I think after a few of the kinks and growing pains are worked out this will be a downtown hangout worth coming back to. Came in yesterday for a quick drink before catching the train to the airport. Quiet, local gay bar. I encountered a nice bartender who pointed me in the right direction to the train stop, so I'm kind of surprised by the negative Yelp reviews as I didn't experience anything remotely like what I've read. Very fun, good food, casual, just up the street from more touristy places. Friendly crowd and staff. Beautifully remodeled, nice and dimly lit with a warm and cozy atmosphere complemented with friendly and attitudeless service.   I find this place great for relaxing with a beer and a shot after work.  Far cry from yesteryear when the establishment was frequented by loud over weight, unattractive, tweakers/drunks with personalities equal to that of underwatered houseplants.  Good moderately priced menu.  I would frequent this place more often if the pool table was less than seventy-five cents per game......or even  free!! Ate here before and enjoyed it, returned recently and I gotta say putting a sticker on your menu saying \\\"due to mimimum wage increases everything on the menu is +$1\\\" is also saying \\\"I'd literally pay my workers less than this if the government would let me\\\" or \\\"I don't care about my employees, so they won't care about the quality of your food.\\\" \\nNever coming back and advising other to not eat here! This is a quiet, relaxing place.  I like that!  If you're looking for loud music and a raucous atmosphere, this isn't the place for you.  But it's a very pleasant place with reasonable prices on food and drink.  Just one word of advice..  if you order steak or prime rib, ask for it to be cooked rare.  They seem to overcook the beef here until it's dry and tasteless. I have had really bad experience here.. But I am updating my review based on my experience with a bartender named Matt... Really awsome... Visit the ba when he is around! This is a nice place to grab a sandwich and a draft beer. Gay friendly, but not all gay. We went on a monday (yesterday eve). It was Labor Day, not crowded at about 5:30pm. My first time there. I got the rueben sandwich and a salad (instead of fries). Salad was crisp and fresh, rueben was good but note that there is very little meat in the sandwich but it was still ok. It was $8 or $7.something.  A friend got the mac and cheese with bacon. A lot of food and very good, but a tad pricey at $9. The 3rd in our group got the Monday special: a small steak, baked potato, brocolli, and side salad all for $9,50. Very good deal. The service was VERY slow. The bartender was also the server. He was busy talking with the two guys sitting at the bar or going outside to smoke to give us any decent service. But who is in a rush? Glad we weren't. So don't get the rueben til they start putting more meat but the other meals, the atmosphere, all worth it. h and maybe don't go on mondays...get a different server that way. we had a rough week, and had been meaning to come here for some time. we came for lunch 12-22-12. began with a bloody mary, and a corona. next, i chose the veggie s. and m. burger on wheat with a salad and oil/vinegar. my partner had the traditional s. and m. burger with fries. the drinks hit the spot, and the food was delicious. our server/bartender was the best...he was so efficient, funny, friendly, and very customer-focused...we will be back...thx so much... Atmosphere here is great, there is a pool table for those that are interested.  My server was very friendly and funny. My only complaint (which is kinda silly), is the well vodka is foul.  I'm not a picky drinker and order well often, but I ordered a drink and a friend did also, both of us could barely choke it down.  Neither were made incorrectly... they were definitely what we ordered, but the vodka was a little odd... almost bitter.  I can't really fault the establishment though, because you can simply choose another brand of vodka; I would recommend they look into switching that out though and again, I'm really not picky with that stuff.  We will definitely be back! I have gone a couple of time in the past year to Fox & Hounds (little bar/food joint) because it is conveniently located near my job.  It's a dive but I continue to go.  Everytime I go the service is late.  This last time I went is the LAST time I will ever go!!!  Let me break it down for you...\\n\\nI walk in and the waiter (they only have one) looks me directly in the face as I walk myself to a booth.  He continues to take care of the table he is serving at the time.  He walks around the bar and walks behind the bar and gets their drinks ready.  He continues to go back to their table with their drinks and will not look at me...keep in mind I'm right behind him.  He walks back to give the cook their orders and then walks behind the bar to chitchat w/the barflies.  I'm staring him down the WHOLE time.  He then goes and gets their food from the cook area.  At that time I go and get my own menu!  I walk back to my booth and he's right behind me!!!  He serves that last table with their food and goes back behind the bar to chitchat.  Finally...20 minutes later he comes over as if nothing is wrong.  He has stupid smile on his face like he knows he should apologize!!!  But he doesn't!  By this time my date (fiance) had shown up and we order.  By the time we are get our food we eat a couple of bites and have to box it up and leave!  Never once did he apologize or anything.  I have, like I said, been to this place a couple of times and every time I feel like I don't get the service that I deserve!!! Cheap good food.  Besides just being across the street from work, the best part about going there is Jeff, the bartender.  LOVE him.  I've only been there for lunch during work, so I haven't tried any drinks, but the food is good for bar food. DO NOT GO HERE\\n\\n(To the owner, feel free to get in contact with us)\\n\\nseriously we used to be regulars and have gone to this bar for over a DECADE!\\n\\nThis is the last time we will ever go to this bar. \\nYou had many chances and disappointed our group every Sunday for the last couple months.\\n\\nIt's Sunday and we called around 2pm, told them a large group of us will be showing up again. (usually ends up being around 10-15 people, plus others who join us and some who leave during our regular meet-ups) They told us they would be open their POSTED HOURS.\\n\\n(That means you were supposed to be open until 11 every Sunday night)\\n\\n we got there and the lights were off and doors locked, it's now only 6:50pm.\\n\\nThe last time we all tried to meet here, (we meet every Sunday here around 7pm) they told us they were no longer serving food for the day because the grill kept catching fire. (Ok I guess)\\n\\nBut then we ordered fried food and eventually (after three orders of only being able to choose from french fries or tater tots, are you kidding me!?) they told us they were no longer doing fried food either!\\n\\nI'm more then sure at this point, as is the rest of the group, they just didn't want to make food.\\n\\nThey closed an hour and half EARLY last Sunday\\nAn hour early the Sunday prior. \\nAnd many times before that.\\n\\nI work in the service industry, I UNDERSTAND wanting to go home, however I suck it up since I chose the field and job. I work 50/60+ hours a week so I really really understand that. But as a manager who covers shifts and volunteers to close, no matter how slow it might get, I ALWAYS stay open. ALWAYS have everything stocked and KNOW my inventory!\\n\\nIF ITS ON THE MENU,  YOU SERVE IT. PERIOD.\\n\\nDONT LET YOUR KITCHEN STAFF COME UP TO THE FRONT OF THE BAR COMPLAINING THAT SOMEONE GOT THEM SWISHER SWEETS INSTEAD OF SOME OTHER CIGARETTES WHILE CURSING LOUDY IN FRONT OF YOUR GUESTS.\\n\\nHOLY MOLY LADY! GOSH HECKIE YOUR STAFF IS A JOKE. \\n\\nFrom one business owner to another. The biggest regret I had when I bought my restaurant was not letting go of staff members who kept dragging it down and had repeated customer service issues. (Everyone gets a second chance) Eventually I let them go and I actually saw a lot of my regulars returning to me. \\n\\nYou should probably let some people go and start covering shifts yourself. Who knows, you might get customers back. \\n\\nI hope other customers step up and complain so you know what the in the world is going on at your bar.\\n\\nGet your staff and your service back in order.\\n\\nYou have lost a large group of customers and although we will be open to talking about a bunch of issues, we will not be returning to this bar again. That's a minimum of 10+ people your staff has alienated. I always knew Fox & Hounds to be a gay dive bar on the level that the Dirty Duck was, so I never really gave it a chance.  Recently a colleague of mine said she loved to go there after work, which I found odd given how I just described the place.  But yesterday I found myself there for some pool and cheap drinks (Hot Toddies for $5.50) and a friendly crowd.   \\n\\nTo me it still seems apparently gay, but I guess I'm a little more in tune with the cues.  My straight colleagues still enjoy themselves, as it should be.  It doesn't feel divey or dirty at all, probably due to their recent remodel.  I know I'll be back here for drinks with co-workers and some good games of pool. F&H is an unassuming sexless gay bar, where they pour cheap, strong drinks, the regulars are hardcore drinkers and the decor and  lighting are atrocious (akin to a Shari's). Fried food, bad music,  tube TV's and video poker add to the ambiance. \\n\\nIn sum, it's too brightly lit,  the vibe is lackluster, the dicks are limp but the drinks ARE stiff.\\n\\nL'Chaim! I'm feeling nice so giving them three stars because things turned around in the last year for me here. I've often wondered what I need to do in order to get half decent service here. It's taken me nearly five years and they treat me better, but still, worse than Denny's.\\n\\nThanks for having such a big menu, there are some edible things on it, which is more than most gay places in this town. I've got stories though... Moldy fried food, and a taco with a raw corn tortilla? Imagine trying to eat that?\\n\\nI go there because my friends who have been around longer go there and they have more money, flirt with the staff and tip them big. I guess that's how it's done... Echoing what the previous reviewers said...total dive bar.  However,  I had a really great experience there and plan on going back when I come back to Portland.  The staff were all friendly and attentive, my drink did not stay empty long without one of the servers asking if I needed another (yes please!).  The drinks themeselves were strong and cheap (ahhh the way I like em!), the food was decent considering the dive-y-ness of the place, the music was fun and the patrons were also friendly and a lot of fun.  There were four of us in our party, and we escaped with plenty of drinks and nibbles for under $60.00, which was worth an additional star. I have been going to the Fox and Hound for over 20 years and always had a good time and ran into lots of friend.  WHAT HAPPENED!!!  Does not feel like a gay bar anymore and Friday nights are dead!  What happened to our friendly bartender- Joe.  Always had great service and a good time.  The last 2 Fridays were horrible!!!! Don't know if I will go back! I have been to the Fox and Hounds a few times and have never been disappointed. I am not a \\\"sit at the bar type a guy\\\" so all my experience comes from sitting at the normal tables. The food, drinks, and service has always been extremely good. As with any place, challenges do arise. However, the one time that it did, the staff was extremely apologetic and took care of the problem right away. As with all the other reviews, the place is beautiful and very inviting to all. Thank you, Fox and Hounds. I will definitely keep coming back. I went here to meet someone for brunch.  To my surprise it was pretty nice.  I had an omelet and coffee for $8.which is a really low price for what you get.\\n\\nThe waiter was a bit absent minded, but it kind of gave the place character.  \\n\\nThe place is a staple low cost place to eat for the local gay community.\\n\\nThis is located just one block from the Chinatown/downtown stop on the Red or Blue MAX light rail trains. Always a favorite place for a good, solid, simple weekend breakfast without the Portland brunch wait. Excellent service. Generous cocktails. Affordable. And, yes, it's a gay bar but we straights are made perfectly welcome. Super nice people. And yes, you may have to maneuver around a couple of street people, but that's Old Town Portland. All good! When I say we get around.. we get around.. ;) Stopped in here Friday night after we couldn't get into the other place we planned so we had to pass the place we were supposed to go and ended up in this place. Had a few drinks in here, the atmophere was nice and friendly. Had a great time just kicking back and having a few. While I would have liked to go dancing.. thats ok.. I can be just as at home in a place like this if not more. \\n\\nI love pursuing downtown when you don't have a car to worry about.. you just from place to place and then you figure out where to catch the max and go home! So much easier and you frequent lots of bars that way too. Just walk from one to the next.. no problem! Would go in here again. They really do look after thier customers! Fox & Hounds is one of those places that's set off from the main path and once you find it, you're glad it is. The atmosphere is pleasant even when it's filled with regulars. It's a great place to grab a beer or a bite and read a book or just be alone with your thoughts but it's also a great place to gather with friends. \\n\\nService is prompt and efficient and provided by a warm, friendly staff. I've never felt rushed here even when they're visibly busy. You're given the feeling that you are your servers' or bartenders' only customer and these days, that kind of service is a rare find. \\n\\nThe menu is descriptive and offers better than the average bar fare. Try the Mac n Cheese with bacon...creamy goodness served with your choice of soup or salad. Generous portions so anticipate taking half your meal home with you. \\n\\nDrinks are cheap and strong. I know what you're thinking, nuff said! This place sucks. I asked for shots for my friends and was told that the bartender didn't \\\"feel like making shots\\\" so we were only allowed beers. What kind of bar does that? He also told us that if we ended up at his bar, we were probably kicked out of a club nearby. Not true at all for our crew, but I guess that's the type of crowd this bar attracts...\\n\\nNo wonder this bar is huge and only has two people other than us on a Friday night. After my second offensive attempt to have a drink at CC's (see my review), I discovered this gem of a bar.  I can't recommend it enough.\\n\\nNice decor, super bartender's, hot looking AND friendly customers, and an above par drink.\\n\\nWhat more can you ask for? Havent been here in awhile. Found out its under new management. Prices are still low drinks are still good. New menu. New pool tables.Gotta love this place. Like with any gay bar in Portland, don't expect attentiveness on your first few visits - unless you are really cute. Bartenders are efficient, not unfriendly and pour a good drink. The beer taps are probably pretty average for Portland and likely will provide something palatable for discerning beer drinkers. \\n\\nIf you hang around the bar a bit you'll notice that the bartenders and some of the regular customers can get rather catty at times - particularly when the odd unknowing group of apparently straight people walk in the door. This can be off-putting or enjoyable depending on your tastes. However, it all seems pretty harmless and just in fun.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty comprehensive and VERY inexpensive. I have tried a few items on the menu and been impressed with the quality. The cook is really very good.  \\n\\nThe place is comfortable, there are several TVs. Don't expect to catch the latest sporting event though. Fine by me. \\n\\nIt really is a nice place to check out particularly with a group of friends. Grab a table if you are seeking a semi-private conversation. Sit at the bar if you enjoy eaves-dropping on (or participating in) the cattiness. Fox & Hounds has been a starting place, mid-party rehydration station, and last stop to some of my best evenings in Portland.  The place is dark and divy, but the staff are always friendly and cheerful.  They make a STRONG long island which is a necessity on any night out in Portland.  It is within walking distance to events like Blow Pony and places like CC Slaughters and Whiskey Bar.  In the middle of the night when you and your friends need a mini break from the party, another drink, and a clean bathroom, go to Fox & Hounds.  Pull up a chair, share a drink, and get a little quality chat time in with your friends before rejoining the party. If you want a place to dine that is fabulous in all areas, make your way to Fox And Hounds.  Great food and fabulous people. Wow!!!!! I posted some photos of Rick and Jeff. These guys make a restaurant experience memorable  Thanks Rick for the awesome service Can't believe the service tonight.  Girl behind the bar seemed off possibly on something or had been drinking.  It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to to get a drink or bottle of beer. We usually come in on Saturday nights and the bartender who has worked there for years and should be experienced is slow and more interested in idle chit chat than serving customers! Leaving won't be back! First time here, and my last. Sat at the bar, and was forced to witness the drunken owner verbally abuse and humiliate his staff in front of a a bar full of customers. As a customer service business owner myself, I was shocked to see an owner behave this way. I heard from a regular customer seated next to me that this happens often here, and that they can't keep staff as a result. I'm surprised this place hasn't been busted by the OLCC since the owner is drunk while on the premises. The food was good, though, and the staff did their best, given who they have to work for. This place has solid food and the the new owner is proactive to to say the least. and I know they've been going through a lot of changes. I've worked in the industry long enough to know things get weird and unpredictable. It's a good bar don't bitch about food issues. If you can't afford a nice brunch or steak at real restaurant that doesn't those things don't bitch about the BAR you are sitting in. Have a drink chill out...Jim... maybe have a more understanding humble point of view...coming from a church goer.\",\n          \"Beer menu is limited but decent, food items are fresh and delicious. Ambient is comfy and spacious, prices are OK for the area. Great FL Beer selection. Friendly bar service and nice fresh vegetables to go. I like this place a lot! We have had beer so many times from here. But honestly we get wine and charceuterie from la femme de Fromage. Unfortunately they disappointed us so we sat at Florida and co. Wonderful experience with perky staff (Jennifer) and good alternative food option from houndstooth The food is amazing. The drinks are great craft brews and mimosas. The environment is chill and relaxing! Great place Friendly staff, locally grown and produced products, craft beer and even personal hygiene products... What more can you ask for? Cute bar too! Nice little local hotspot inside East End Market just as you enter. The beautiful natural wood counter invites their customers in to their bar stool seating. The staff are welcoming and knowledgeable on their only local ingredients menu. To be honest, we only came for the drinks menu, but they do serve what looks to be delicious food.\\nMy other half ordered their very affordable beer flight, which included 5 beer samples for just $10! I on the other hand orders their Shrub which is a flavored vinegar with sparking wine or water. Let's just say he got the better end of the deal. Even though their options for beer are limited on draft, the options were tasty. As for me, I should've just stuck with me gut and gotten wine. The Bees Knees with sparkling water was boring. It tasted like just like water at first then a sour honey at the end. I gave it another try with their Mayhaw Berry option, which wasn't any better. To tart for my taste unfortunately.\\nNeedless to say I'm sure we will be back for their beer flight again and just avoid the Shrubs and order their food the next go around. Shout out to Florida & Co for repping the sunshine state HARD! From locally sourced ingredients, to brews from all over our lovely state- this spot is showcasing the flavors of all the fun under the Florida sun.\\n\\nDavid was awesome - and helped to prepare a great Beer Flight for me. From stouts to ciders, I got a chance to try 5 different beers. My two favorites were the Apple Cider from Keel and Curly as well as the Key Lime Beer from Key Billy. \\n\\nI also had a chance to try the Shrimp and Grits my momma ordered. This was as hearty as you'd expect a shrimp and grits to be, but not as decadent as your traditional southern preparation. \\n\\nMade with coconut oil instead of butter, the bowl of grits was topped with hearty portions of shrimp, greens, peppers and onions. It was so flavorful and almost too pretty to eat!\\n\\nThis spot has high top tables and a good amount of bar seating, but they'll also bring your food outside if you decide to dine al fresco.\\n\\nThey've also got a good selection of wines - even some wine on tap! They offer flights of wine as well which is fun. We discovered this little gem while waiting to  get into Domu. We took the server's suggestion, ordered a beer off their featured list and got the small plate Red Snapper Ceviche w/ plaintain chips (idk why it says chips, they were delicious, juicy and thick like normal fried plantains). I thought the ceviche was kind of sharp/acidic but my boyfriend loved it. Definitely recommend the ceviche on top of the plaintain to cancel out some of the acidity (even if it is a bit hard to scoop).\\n\\nCant wait to visit again! : ) A place you can buy local groceries and drink local beer and wine too?! What a unique concept!\\n\\nI haven't drank here yet, but I am very familiar with many of the brews they have on tap and sold as bottles. They are all high quality craft beers, all of which look to be brewed right here in Florida. One side of their grocery counter acts as a bar, where about 5 people can sit and enjoy their beer. You'll also see people sitting outside drinking too.\\n\\nSo far I have only bought a dozen eggs here, picked locally, for $4 a dozen. These are the same eggs you might have seen at the Audubon Park Farmers market. Browsing through their selection, they also have all local arugula, lettuces, heirloom tomatoes, squashes, and frozen meats. Plus spices and bottles of vanilla.\\n\\nI'm looking forward to having a cold local beer here one of these days. Went for the first time two days ago and was extremely impressed!  The pesto meatballs over zucchini \\\"pasta\\\" was fabulous as well as the ceviche, which was equally good.  It was great to be able to drink a grapefruit mimosa with fresh grapefruit pulp in it.  Yummy.  The decor and ambiance was steller!  I highly recommend. Great beer election, very helpful staff. They also have a variety of different products ranging from produce to beard cleanser to vanilla extracts. If you are in Orlando, you absolutely must visit the East End Market and stop by Local Roots. Love east end market overall as a whole but the service at Florida & Co beer was not good at all. We sat,  the guy working took several minutes just to greet us and when he did it wasn't friendly..as if we were a bother. There were only 2 other patrons and he engaged them 100% of the time, non-stop talking  about himself and his plans.  Very disappointing as I'm a local and visit this place often. One should engage, conversation with all customers,  be friendly to all. Thankfully there are other great local shops here with excellent customer service! Florida & Co. is the first place (on the left) when you walk in the front entrance at East End Market.  It used to be called Local Roots, but has been going through a branding change.  My husband and I ordered brunch from  Farm Haus (at the back left of East End) and then sauntered over to the bar at Florida & Co.\\n\\nWe were quickly greeted by two staff members that saw us eyeing their draft menu.  They provided recommendations based on the types of beers we like and my husband and I both ended up with drafts that we enjoyed.  The staff said that we could sit at their counter and eat/drink or we could wander around East End Market with our beers, no need to feel stuck there.  As we were waiting on our food to be ready, we took a seat at the bar there, and remained there eating once we got our food.\\n\\nThe offer locally sourced items such as meat, beer, body products, and honey.  Some of the items seemed a bit pricey to me, but others were what I expected at any market or grocery store.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and chatty with those the customers that were also chatty.  Overall, a great first beer at Florida & Co.  I'm sure we will continue to check out what they have on tap during our visits to the Market. This is an awesome place to find Florida local items. I love shopping small and shopping local, and this place kills two birds with one stone, as it were. They have everything from local craft beers to t-shirts that let you showcase your local love with a great shirt!\\n\\nI'll be headed back to snatch up the honey butter in the cold case. Couldn't take it on my last visit since I wasn't headed home, and it needs to be kept cool.\\n\\nThe staff greeted my sister and I right away and offered help on anything we wanted more info on. I also fell in love with the local roots t-shirt that had the Orlando city skyline on it. \\n\\nOverall: A\\nThis place rocks. I love local stuff and this place has it all! Amazing first experience. Ordered the Southern spicy with Florida white shrimp with a soft egg. Was extremely delicious, I was licking the bowl. Had the right balance of citrus and spice! What can I say it was delicious. Located at the front of the East End Market, Local Roots Farm Store offers a nice selection of items. Greens, veggies, farm fresh eggs, meats and nice locally made pantry items like Mannix Vanilla, grits and home and bath products. \\n\\nThe beautiful wood bar offers up a nice spot to enjoy Quantum Leap wines and Florida brewed craft beers. (Including Cask & Larder) Try a flight and sample your way through some great wines or craft brews. Local Roots offers wifi and a spot to sit down to enjoy your delicious sandwich from Hounds Tooth or maybe La Bretxa. Service is attentive and warm, if you prefer to soak up the beautiful Florida day, it's OK to take your glassware outside to the picnic tables or enjoy the courtyard. I love East End Market and Local Roots is one of the tenant merchants that help cement that love! This is the store that helps make EEM a market. I am able to stop by, pick up some bread, local meat, eggs, and a bottle of something fun!\\n\\nAs previous reviews have mentioned, LR has a fabulous wooden counter that you can sit at while sipping on local wine and beer (sometimes they even have rare brews!). I've also sat there having a coffee from Lineage when EEM was fairly empty and they had no problem with this. \\n\\nThey carry various seasonal greens, local organic meat & poultry, eggs ($4/dozen~ I can dig those prices!), locally-made greeting cards, lotions & elixirs, etc. I always get my eggs here now since they are so cheap and who can beat local, free-range eggs? No one. That's who.\\n\\nBut what always keeps me coming back is the service (isn't it  always that?). The person behind the counter is always incredibly nice and always seems genuinely interested in the customer. Last time I was there I bought some eggs, mentioned that they were for my sister's after-wedding brunch, and the woman gushed to my sister and wished her so much happiness and love. It was so nice and more than just a quick 'congrats.' \\n\\ntl;dr - Great eggs, great service = 5 stars Great selection of local and regional beers on tap and they have a sampler platter my favorite! The good service others rave about was absent during my recent weekend morning visit. A buddy and I sat down to eat food from the bakery across the hall - it was already 82 degrees at 11 a.m. and we didn't want to eat outside. \\n\\nThe Local Roots \\\"bartender\\\" said he only had beer and wine. No cold non-alcoholic drinks. He filled a pitcher with warm tap water (no ice), poured us each a glass and then put the pitcher out of reach. We downed the waters quickly - we'd been out biking - and started at our empty glasses while he spent five minutes counting coins in his coin box.\\n\\nNot wanting to be a pain I waited a while before getting up, walking over, and asking for a refill. He obliged - and then put the warm water pitcher out of reach again before walking off to adjust the twine holding the price tag to the kale basket at the back of the store. Same thing again, staring at empty glasses. There were 0-2 other customers in the store this whole time. \\n\\nI understand that we were not paying customers, but the bartender lost a chance to build goodwill and attract a future customer that would evangelize for a business that looks like it needs all the evangelism it can get. What would I have done in his shoes?\\n\\n- Poured the pitcher and then left it for us to \\\"self serve,\\\" freeing him to other duties\\n\\n- Gotten ice for the pitcher without putting the customer in the awkward position of being the 'I am only here drinking free water, and now you're asking me if you should walk across the building on my account for some ice' guy\\n\\n- Poured a couple little taster glasses of beer and slipped them in front of us unbidden. If we turn them down, the bartender just wasted 50 cents of product. If we drink them, he's got customers for life. (\\\"Hey! I'm that bartender's best friend! He just gave me a free beer!) Local Roots, you better clear out a permanent stool at your bar for me. I love your variety of all things Florida. From carrying local beers and wines to handmade hards and deli items. Aside from the eye catching wooden bar, the unique wooden taps truly draw a passerby's attention in. While we were a bit disappointed that we couldn't score a space at the bar to enjoy our Original Sin Pear Cider, we were more than happy to get some vitamin D with our brew at one of the outdoor picnic tables. \\n\\nI could reiterate all the positive things that the reviewers before me touched upon, but what stood out in my mind is the supremely chill vibe given off by the gents running the counter. They were helpful and very efficient despite every seat being taken at the bar. I loved the homemade feeling of everything, like I was welcomed at the counter in their personal kitchen. The chalkboard with the tap listing was a bit small, but it was effective in drawing us up to the counter to take a closer look. \\n\\nI hope I can time my next visit better, so I can pick the brains of the staff and learn more about their business. Those visiting EEM, make this a pitstop on your list whether you're buying a beverage or finding something deliciously local to take home with you. We fancied ourselves a beer while munching on our grilled cheese from La Femme du Fromage (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-femme-du-fromage-orlando?hrid=6G5cYcOnpwibl63Eib6mCA) and Local Roots was able to fill that need. With local beers on tap & the option to get a flight we were able to taste several beers from around the Sunshine State. \\n\\nLoved the wooden bar! Such a cool design. While we didn't purchase anything on this visit, I did love perusing the wares of the shop and thinking about what I might need to pick up next time. If I lived around the corner in the neighborhood, this would be the perfect place to stop to pick up something for dinner. \\n\\nThe gentleman behind the bar was super friendly and didn't rush us in any way even as the crowd started to pick up around lunch time. There's plenty of seating (~15 stools) at the bar so you shouldn't have too hard a time finding a place to sit. Absolutely love this cute and local vendor at East End Market! Florida & Co. serves local craft beers as well as wine and sparkling cocktails. I'm excited to try their food menu next. Apparently you get 25% off your tab when you eat dinner here, even alcohol. Do yourself a favor and try the shrubs. It sounds weird, but they are so good. They are more of an elixir that they mix with sparkling soda or champagne. I loved the hibiscus and Mayhan the best. And if you're looking to try a different wine or beer offered, go for the flights. They are a great deal. You can bring your drinks around the market or even go outside and listen to the live band that might be there. Or just sit at the bar and enjoy some friendly conversation with Emily and Perrin. One of my favorite dishes is shrimp & grits.  The dish as prepared  by Florida & Co offers a delicious healthier option to the traditional southern dish.  Not the less in flavor, it is prepared with coconut oil and adds Swiss chard and kale along with savory shrimp and an egg on top. The ingredients are locally sourced and are fresh   It is a dish worth repeating.  The setting is so nice. You can eat outside or inside at counter seating. They serve wine and also some craft beers on draft. I Can't wait for the next time I'm visiting the area to stop in at East end Market to try it again. Florida & Co is so good it will change your mind about Orlando. It proves it's more than a city just centered around touristy Disney World and full of gross, fried food. WRONG! \\n\\nFlorida & Co is a locally sourced restaurant inside the cool East End Market that prioritizes low sugar foods. On top of that, they sell some of Florida's best craft beer and ciders.\\n\\nI ordered the Mojo bowl or lunch with brown rice, kale, sweet peppers, orange slices, and Florida wild shrimp. It was all steamed and came with a light lime garlic sauce. It was so good, healthy, and balanced the flavors well (the orange slices were perfect and, yes, you are meant to eat the orange peel).\\n\\nThe drink list is really good and they always have a local cider on tap. I ordered the acai cider from Accomplice Brewery and it was one of the best drinks I've ever had.\\n\\nOn top of that, the space is beautiful with a few tables off to the side and a long wood bar to sit at. Also, the service is excellent and friendly! Claim to be a small craft brewery specialist, doesn't even know the difference between white IPA and a pale ale... food is pretty good but owner is incompetent, decent experience but made it hard to enjoy a beer due to bad attitude. Stick too food here This place is a wonderful staple in the East end market. The last few times I've been here have been as a layover type visit- while waiting on a table at Domu or just for cheese (from the fromage) and beer but I need to change that as their menu has expanded and looks rather tasty AND healthy. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the local craft beers they have and are always willing to let you sample something before you decide. The bar front seating can be limited but they are more than willing to let you sit outside with drinks and will deliver food to you outside as well. I came here a few weekends ago with friends and it was so amazing! It's located inside East End Market so a great place to hangout on a Saturday or Sunday morning. They have ample seating space, extremely friendly employees, and a menu full of feel-good, delicious meals and snacks. I ordered the Florida Bowl with Shrimp. It did take a few minutes to prepare, but I was the first customer of the morning and they prepared everything fresh which was nice. The bowl began with a bed of rice, a hearty portion of greens, ample pickled vegetables, and a deliciously light cilantro-lemongrass sauce. Four or five large shrimp adorned the top of the bowl. \\n\\nI absolutely loved this! First of all, it was piping hot and extra comforting on a rainy morning. At $15 a bowl, you really get a perfect sized portion-- enough to feel like you've got your money's worth, but not simply loaded with cheap fillers. The cilantro-lemongrass sauce was truly a standout. A lot of times I order things with sauce on the side because they're too often heavy handed in the application, or way too oily. There was just the right amount of sauce added to this bowl and it wasn't loaded down with weird oils. Absolutely wonderful-- highly recommend! I was really excited to come to this place to try some ceviche. I'm not sure if it was the advertising , but it looks delicious. Surely enough it was. However their is always more then one aspect to a dining experience! Let's take it from the top! \\n\\nI'd like to start with the parking. Which you have to acknowledge as lackluster. It is understandable, for a market that shares space with several different kinds of businesses. However, space is available right outside of East End as it does tend to fill up quickly and for many hours on end. All within a short walking distance and free. No worries! \\n\\nFlorida and Co is located right up front on your left as soon as you enter. The aesthetic immediately captures your attention and if seafood is your thing, then it will also captures your tastebuds. Upon seating ourselves and reviewing the menus. We ordered 2 waters which were filled a quarter full each time (including the one refill). I'm not sure if that is part of the experience or not. No big deal, I finally settled upon ordering the ceviche bowl and anxiously awaited as I contained my growling stomach! \\n\\nMy favorite time arrived as I received my food within minutes and was extremely excited to eat this meal. I went with the jasmine rice option as well and really hoped for a nice heaping bowl of ceviche for $15. To my dismay, I received the bowl, minus the heaping. It turned out to be enough food for about half the actual size of the bowl. In all fairness, the food was absolutely delicious. The fish was very fresh and the acidity and lime really work well together in the ceviche. The onions are proportionate and the jasmine rice is to die for. \\n\\nA restaurant is much more than a food establishment though, it is at its heart. A service based business. I would like to mention Kristen as a very nice and helpful employee. I say this because Kristen turned out to be the only one their that morning who actually put on a nice friendly smile and sought to uphold the customer service standard. Aside from that, I must note that the service in general was bad. After paying for my purchase and putting the tablet on the table for my girlfriend to pay for her meal, the  employee across from us snatched the tablet and gives it to a couple next to me, forcing us to awkwardly wait for someone to check out before us in the middle of us checking out. That was really uncomfortable for me. I still left a tip because I appreciate the hard work small business go through and just want to show my support in anyway possible. \\n\\n\\nOverall, the food is good here. I don't warn anyone against going here. If ceviche or seafood is your thing, you might want to go for it. As for me, Unfortunately, I will not be back, but I do have high hopes for the future of this business! Their food is just amazing. Have you ever had the first bite of something and literally say \\\"OH MY GOD\\\" this is so good and just be in  over it? Lol yeah this places does that to me every time. Everyone who works there is also super nice and helpful. Love love love. If you haven't tried it you MUST! Every time I hit up East End, I always go to Gideon's and Domu. But this time I finally gave the other spots a try, which led me to the zucchini noodle bowl at Florida & Co. they're clearly capitalizing on the fad diets of New Years Resolutions, which is fine by me! The zucchini was crunchy and it soaked up that great pecan pesto sauce. Topped it with their homemade meatballs and red sauce, and I was in heaven. The bowl packed flavor and savor and it satisfied my pasta needs. We came here for another establishment but on our way out of this indoor farmers market type place we made a pit stop. My husband tried a sample of the Central 28, Upriver American Pale Ale 6%. He enjoyed it so much he went ahead and got a glass for $7.00. \\n\\nI will say their beer pairs well with Gideons cookies. 5 Stars for all of the reasons mentioned in my prior review and now some fabulous prepared food!\\n\\nThere's still the local beers, locally made products, and tasty wines, but what was once Local Roots is now Florida & Co., and it provides another great option for prepared food at East End Market.\\n\\nI took a seat at one of their round high top tables and ordered the (local meat) meatball sandwich and a rice bowl of pickled veggies, lettuce, and shrimp. Of course, I forgot to take a picture of the menu, so I don't have the official names of these dishes, but it seems like anything you order off this menu is going to be quality and full of flavor.\\n\\nThe meatball sandwich was hearty and had enough acidity to leave you feeling light afterwards. Which is the first time I can remember feeling that after a meatball sub. The rice bowl had thinly sliced pickled cucumbers, carrots, and beautiful lettuce leaves (I want to say butter lettuce, but I'm not great at identifying greens...). But the star of the dish was the shrimp. There were plenty of perfectly seasoned shrimp (no poop vein!) and a bite of pickled vegetables with shrimp is flavor perfection!\\n\\nService was great (thanks, David!) and the round tables gave more privacy for lunch meetings than when you used to only have the bar as an option. There's not as much selection in terms of produce or local gifts, but that's been replaced with really, really good food. So, overall, a great change!\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1075,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Can't comment on customer service since I just ordered online for delivery.  I would order again if I'm working in the area again. This Jimmy Johns is the worst that I've been to and I frequent them a lot. The staff are not friendly and the subs are very thin, not worth the money. Food tastes as expected (what you want from a chain). Took close to forty minutes and I was a mile away - not freaky fast. The beach club is my favorite! Awful! I ordered my food at 11:05 and didn't receive it until 1:40. Customer service was awful. The service here was horrible.  Staff is very unfriendly!  I had to tell the girl 3 times before she got my order correct and then she acted like it was my fault.  I will not be coming back.  The jalape\\u00f1o chips are good but their tuna tasted like it died a slow painful death. \\\"Freaky Slow\\\" should be this locations motto. I ordered online and 15 minutes before arriving to the store and when I got here I had to wait another 15. Very poorly managed store, absolutely ridiculous, they even have a huge staff on hand. Ok let's start by say the loud music as if I'm walking into a night club. Then I look at the menu before I get to the cash register and I stand the for a minute before I say something to the guy that is standing there and refuse to face me to take my order WTH. Then he whispers do you want cheese on that and I said yes, come to find out I was charged extra for the cheese. WHAT IS A SANDWICH WITHOUT DARN CHEESE SMH IM DONE WITH PLACE. Now for the group of employees that make the place look like a hang out spot IM DONE DROPPING THE MIC My wife and I are here with out 2 yr old son.  We each ordered a sandwich and began to eat, feeding our son from our own sandwich.  We quickly realised he was only interested in the bread so went up to grab a day old bread for 50 cents. The kind gentlemen behind the counter asked if it was for the little guy and gave it to him for free, asking if we needed any sauces on it for him.  Give the place a shot; what a kind, selfless thing to do! Nice refreshing change of pace from the old fast food burger joints. My wife and I order from here regularly. The app works great for us and the delivery is always really fast.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are always correctly put together and the quality is great. You definitely get what you pay for. \\n\\nAs a suggestion, I always ask them to \\\"take some bread out\\\" when ordering the French bread, it helps to eat the sandwhich without losing the goods. What I don't understand how people manage to hire employees with bad attitudes and let them be the face of a business.3 employees working with no smile, no greeting and bad attitude like someone killed their cat. \\nWalked up to the counter and I get greeted with \\\"whatchu want\\\". Ordered a sub an Asked for a cup of water, got a dreadful reply \\\"we are out of water cups\\\" with absolutely no sense of remorse, let alone a \\\"sorry\\\". It's like I am not giving them business, they are doing me a favor by serving me.\\nIf you hate your jobs so much, don't spoil your customer's mood with bad attitude. Go find another job or leave your f-ing attitude at home. I ordered 2 sandwiches to be delivered. 45 mins later? I'm still waiting. Apparently the B Team is working because it would have absolutely faster to drive there myself, eat, and drive back. If you order delivery...really any time of the day... expect a call telling you they either \\\"don't have bread\\\" or they'll tell you they don't have a delivery driver. Freaky fast delivery? More like freakishly unpredictable and incredibly unreliable/nonexistent delivery. Absolutely obnoxious. Food is always fresh and good, however the service is terrible.  They never get the order right and the employees are rude and not helpful.  The GM is terrible.  AVOID Terrible customer service including the manager. Had a driver yell for not getting a tip, do better the food is still great I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but this jimmy johns not only got our order wrong twice when we were in the store, we realized after we had left that they had forgotten to put meat on two of the sandwiches. The sandwich also left my stomach very unsettled making me think I got a touch of food poisoning too. This jimmy johns needs some serious improvement. I've been here several times, and every time the service has not met Jimmy Johns status. My last visit is what pushed me to write this review and to not return.\\n\\n1. The lady making my sandwich was bossy and yelling at her kids while she was making my sandwich.\\n\\n2. They locked all the doors when they closed in an hour and a half. When I was unlocking the door to leave, the same lady demandingly yelled and told me not to unlock the door. How do you except me to leave? I ignored her and opened it anyway.\\n\\n3. Same lady lied to me. When she handed me my sandwich she said the bread was hard because it just came out of the oven. But it wasn't hot. I'm a professional baker, bread is hard because you burned it or its stale. I wasn't going to complain but don't lie to me. The bread wasn't enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n4. They are slow compared to most Jimmy Johns.\\n\\n\\nDon't yell at me don't lie to me and send your kids home. I'm used to getting fast, friendly service at Jimmy John's. This place was neither of those things. I was the only customer there, so it's not like they were too busy. The lady who was making my sandwich started to make it, and then stopped so she could finish her conversation with I coworker. The sandwich wasn't put together very well. I don't expect to visit this location again. Just like the commercials say, this place is FAST.  By the time I paid and finished putting my change in my wallet they were handing me a sandwich.  I thought they were accidentally handing me someone else's... LOL\\nOn my most recent visit, I ordered The Vito.  It was noticeably fresh with decent flavor, but it could have used a little more meat and liquid (oil, vinegar, mustard, mayo). \\nIf you are pressed for time though as I was on this day, this is your perfect lunch spot. First off customer service definitely lacked. Walking in it looked like they were closed. Crew members were sitting and leaning on tables and loud music was playing. The girl that took my order was slightly rude (making a comment to a sauce I wanted on my sandwich). When wrapping up my order, the same girl that took my order reaches into the pickle jar and takes a pickle with her BARE HANDS. Ew never will I ever come back to this establishment. No one wants to spend money at a place where the employees clearly don't care. This use to be my favorite Jimmy Johns location but the quality of workers has really brought the service down.  My last visit during my transaction the cashier (named Marie ) never spoke or looked at  me once..  I'm not kidding.  I walked in she stood next the register so i started giving my order, she put her hand out for my credit card and gave me a receipt.  I have to find a new favorite location. Walked in the other day. Ordered a sandwich to go. The gentlemen who helped me were very nice and accommodating. It was my first time ever being at a JJ's and they were patient and answered all my questions Sandwich was made fresh. Since I wasn't eating the sandwich right away, I was worried about it getting soggy. Not the case. I ate half and ended saving the other half for even later and it was still fresh! Even though I didn't eat it there, still a clean establishment. I called for a delivery order at 4 pm.  The lady taking my order was more interested in talking to someone else about going on breaks.  She was VERY RUDE to me (as a paying customer) and acting like I was interrupting her.  WTF Jimmy Johns.  I know you are better than this. \\n\\nSOO.... 30 minutes later (when my order should have been delivered) the same rude woman calls me back to let me know their delivery driver will not be in for work until 5 pm.  WHY WASN'T I TOLD THIS WHEN I ORDERED????  She offers no apology or any explanation.  She advises me that I can wait until their driver shows up for work OR I can come pick it up myself.  I cancelled the order. This location will not have my business any longer. \\n\\nThis Jimmy John's is terrible and DOES NOT live up to their company standards.  It's pathetic. Customer service at this location is the worst i have ever expirienced.  \\n\\nI called in an order. I may have as well gone through  a drive through.  You know what happens there.  You get F#@#@ed. \\n\\n I   asked if my special request had been fulfilled and was told  yes.  Upon return to work i found that the request was honored but my order was worng.  \\n\\nWhen i called to complain is when the horrible service began.  That store is run by incompetent extremely rude people.\\nI was  told that there  was no way to speak with the owner of this franchise location.  No response from a call i have in to him either.   I guess the poor service is from top to bottom.   Will never go there again. I didn't get his name, but the guy with dreads fixed my sandwich. His sandwich counter was filthy and he didn't follow any directions on light mayo, light mustard etc. Super fast but that because they barely made the sandwich. Turkey sandwich what could go wrong... let me tell you. \\nI had to search for the lettuce due to such a small amount even a friend asked if I ordered no lettuce. There was more mayo than turkey, I guess 1 slice of turkey is the spec because the whole office enjoyed their bread and mayo experience.  But it was fast.  Increase your quality and not just speed. I called in my order and when I got there girl was cleaning down and never made my food. Took off cleaning glove picked up new glove and made my tuna sandwich. But she was stoned and store smelled like trees, they had the door open. I walked into pot lounge. Never going back Horrible customer service and unprofessional delivery driver. Why would you call a customer to complain about an accidental tip online. You never know what someone has waiting on you IN CASH! Oh and they hang up on you too. Never give this location business. Hopefully they all lose their jobs in the next few months. I think Jimmy John's has a pretty good product. The meat is pretty fresh, as well as the lettuce. Their bread is pretty tasty too. You can expect to pay $7 and change for a sandwich or $11 and change for a combo. If their prices were a tad bit cheaper I'd say it's worth five stars. All in all it's a convenient, healthy option for lunch! Worst seen to date!! Ordered online and the app showed that it was made and out for delivery within 20 min... well, after an hour I called and they said they had to bake the bread and it was cooling and that they would make it in about 10 min. It was finally delivered 1 hr and 40 min after it was ordered. Almost TWO hours for a sandwich!!! WOW... This is the absolute worst Jimmy John's I've ever been to.  They are very slow, customer service is terrible, they can't make a sandwich like you ordered if their life depended on it.  They argue with you if you call them out on their error and insist you are wrong...  Um.... I'm the customer, remember?  I used to go here every week, but I don't think I'll be back unless there's a real turnover in employees.  It's a real shame too. Went to Jimmy Johns after work because nothing else was open for vegans around that area. This was around 9:20p. I got the veggie club. They started making the sandwich and said they were out of tomato. I said \\\"you don't have any at all?\\\". She was like yea but they're in the back and I would have to cut it. (With a attitude) She then looked at the time like I was wasted her time to close and clean up. This staff has always been over it and looked like they don't want to work there. Not surprising really. Giving two stars because she actually cut the tomato for me, attitude and all.\",\n          \"Food was adequate for what it was. My boyfriend ordered a Mojito, they had no mint, said nothing and instead ended up with what tasted like crystal light, vodka and too much lime juice....not terribly interested in returning. This is a dive that I used to go to, but do not anymore because of a proximity factor. As I said it is just a dive to meet and chat, have a drink with friends, and so expectations not being to high, it never really disappoints. Service is kind of lacking sometimes. I was happy with the Nachos. Wish there was more cheese on it. But the guacamole was top notch!\\n\\nHeads UP: They have a 50 cent charge for take out. Cheap drinks, lots of room, realy friendly bar tender, cheap pool, and lots of fun alcoholics. so cute. really close to the max and a great haven to escape from the crazies on skidmore. WTF.... Had to pay for food before even ordered ...Hmmm ever been to burger king if so EAT ThERE service is better and the food with out  a thought 10000 times better.\\nAs for service stay away from the bartender Joe just a wipe we brought my partner's parents here and had the veggie s/m burger with salad. my partner had the eggs benedict, and they shared the french dip with fries. everything was delicious, and the server was so friendly and efficient. love the atmosphere. Went in for lunch during the week and sat in a booth far away from the bar.  I think all the action was at the bar because we never got any service.  When we first sat down someone asked us what we would like and we said we needed a minute. Then no one ever came back.  After a while we just got up and left and ate some place near by because being ignored made us feel awkward and I didn't want to go ask for service and seem rude.  I'm just too passive to eat here. This is my fav lunch and dinner spot. The service is too notch and the food is excellent. There is a new owner who is committed to the bar and her employees. I really appreciate her commitment as a regular. They have switched up the menu and introduced craft cocktails! I recommend coming down to this spot for lunch, dinner or happy hour. I hear the brunch is spot on also I am excited for Pride! The place will be packed! I had no idea this bar was over here. In this side of town you just get used to your usual places unless you live downtown, work there or spend way too much time in bars...no offense...everyone needs hobbies right. I love the decor which seemed pretty butch and no dive bar at all - I was confused as to the reviews mentioning it as a dive since that was not the impression I got at all though I hear they went through a remodel. The staff were amazing and when we went there with a Barfly bus filled with 40 they slammed our drink orders out smoking fast. The drinks were well priced and well made too. Nothing screamed gay bar at all and there was a birthday party happening with catering and everything which was neat - that they can section off parts like that. My boyfriend and I frequent this bar, but not just for the drinks.  We are both big fans of the food.  Attention is paid to the quality of the meals you get and the prices are reasonably low for the the amount they serve you.  The service tends to be kind of spotty, a bit of a hit or miss sort of thing, but there are a few waiters/bartenders that make it all the more worth it to stop in.  It is conveniently located just off the max line and is very easy to find if you know what you are looking for, though we found that we had actually walked by the place several times without even being aware of it's existence.  It is relatively conservative inside on the decor, and not nearly as in-your-face as something like The Eagle, but you still sense a presence of acceptance and tolerance.  It is not uncommon to see men dressed as women at the bar ordering a drink and talking to the bartenders as old friends.  It's a welcoming environment.\\nMy only suggestion for the place would be to hire on a new waiter or two.  There have been several times my boyfriend and I have gone in and had to wait an unusually long time to have our orders taken, or to get our check.  We don't mind too much, especially considering there is typically 1-2 people working as bartenders and doubling as waiters.  It isn't there fault, I just hope that management notices that many of their customers aren't as tolerant to their short-staffed nature as my boyfriend and I are.  \\nAll in all, this place is a good time with great food.  Check it out when you're not in a hurry and ask about the specials-some of them are REALLY great deals.  Cheers! Absolutely HORRIBLE service!!!! Refused to give us water unless we bought alcohol first! Completely outrageous behavior from the bartender, will never go there again. Have never been treated so horribly I've been to Fox & Hounds a handful of times now, and each time it's the same bartender. That's comforting. It's a nice, \\\"old man bar\\\" - but, there aren't a lot of old men here, generally speaking. For a nice, quiet gay bar, I highly suggest this place. If C.C. Slaughters is too loud for you to talk, pop on in to Fox & Hounds and have a few drinks. \\n\\nThey have a pretty extensive menu, as well - including your old standby's of fried bar food. The French Dip is simple but quite good. The Jalapeno Poppers are a favorite. The Chicken Strips and Fries are quite sufficient and tasty. \\n\\nOne pool table, lots of seating, friendly establishment. The location to the dance club of Slaughters night life is perfect. I'd definitely try stopping in and not let previous reviews strip you of the opportunity to support this local establishment. A couple weeks ago, my friend and I went to Fox & Hounds for the Ladies of Rock drag show fundraiser for various charities. We got there super early and the servers were very attentive. My friend and I had just eaten dinner somewhere else and weren't really looking to order anything food/ drink wise, so we tried to stay under the radar with the ordering. Eventually the place filled up and we didn't have to keep saying we were waiting for friends to order. Anyway, I would definitely come here again for another drag show. I'm glad I didn't drink because the unisex bathrooms were kind of gross (why can't boys pee IN the toilet?) and I didn't want to have to go again. That's my only real criticism... I would not waste your time or money at The Fox & Hounds.  I went there with a friend the other night to grab some food and a beer.  The restaurant from the street looked inviting and the atmosphere pleasant.  We sat ourselves, per instruction from the sign in the entrance, and waited for our server.  We waited and waited and waited.  20 minutes later our server, real short hair and balding, pale in complection and rocking 2 tattooed arm sleeves, came over to us and apologized for the wait saying he didn't see us.  I wasn't sure how that could be as we were sitting in direct line of sight.  No problem, I'll take his word for it and let it go.  We got our menus and ordered beers right away.  20 minute wait made us thirsty.  Our server proceeded to take a beverage order for a table of 8 next to us.  Then he shot back up to the bar and began doing I don't know what.  At one point he removed his shirt to expose his white tank-top undershirt.  A little classless but whatever- I'm not judging.  10 minutes later the server came over with drinks in his hands for the table of 8.  That was the last straw for me and we got up and left.  Upon exiting the server asked us \\\"oh, are you guys leaving?\\\" Either he had no clue of his poor customer service on display or he just didn't really want to serve us.  Whatever way you look at it, it was poor poor service.  I wish I could comment on the food but we didn't get that far.  Portland has many, many food options and The F&H is not worth your time! It's not a busy Saturday afternoon but, a lot of dirty tables. Every ketchup bottle was almost empty it took three to get enough for my fries. Plus the bottles were all dirty. Napkins were non existent. No line at the bar but, I had to wait over five minuets to get a Coke while the bartender chatted with his friend. \\nBartender was super nice & food is improved over the old management but, some serious side work etc needs to be taken into consideration. One bus tub and about five minuets would have had the dining room looking neat. I hit Fox's regularly. It's like \\\"Cheers\\\" for the Portland gay crowd.  Food is reasonable and good, drinks are strong, and the atmosphere is warm, inviting, friendly.  Friday happy hour is great. The ambience is Cheers-esque, which happened to be playing on the tv above the bar when I was there for lunch recently. It's neighborhoody. There are regulars. The bartender learns your name. The service is very good--the bartender who is also the waiter during the day is warm without being over the top. He's sincere, low-key, and consistent.\\nThe food is actually pretty good. Some things shine--like their daily soups. The beer and cheese soup that I had was one of the best beer and cheese soups I've ever had. And their grilled cheese is just like mom used to make. On the surface, it's a three star joint. But something about it keeps inviting me back. So I'll throw it another star for that ineffable 'come back' quality. Been to this restaurant before, food and atmosphere were not anything special. Now, on their menu, they are blaming increased prices on new minimum wage laws. I will not in any way support a restaurant that takes worker protections out on their own employees. I feel bad for those people. Your employer is clearly terrible and you should probably seek new employment. Shame on you, Fox and Hounds. I will never return to your establishment and will encourage my friends, family and colleagues to do the same. If you have a problem with local laws, take it out on your legislators, not on your workers and the community. That was nice bar... Good taste ... Meeting friend and drink and eat .. Kind of relaxing place to go there ... The bartender is surprisingly rude & slow despite there being 9 people here not ordering, just listening to shitty 80's music and being old/bitter. \\n10ish minutes after ordering, they told us they didn't have the ingredients for what we ordered, and were uppity when we asked to see the menu again. They messed up my order, and what I got was an over-priced, dried out travesty. And everyone 45+ and/or bitter lesbian/gay got better service than us (young gays), point of order: came in after us, got food before us. That autistic guy isn't lying! And their fugly regulars decided to chime in when my friend had a \\\"difficult\\\" vegetarian order (#SorryNotSorry it's 2015 and you live in Portland). Not coming back. Good food, inexpensive drinks.  The dinner special on Friday was Prime Rib for $12.50!  How could you pass that up?\\n\\nI rarely had to wait at the bar for service, the bartender was friendly. Until last night, I had only been to Fox and Hounds once with a friend for a quick stroll through and once during Pride Week when everyone was drunk and acting crazy. \\nLast night, a friend and I went for happy hour and dinner.  This area of town seems to be really calm and slow until later at night, which is cool, if you just want a relaxed time.  There were maybe two other people when we arrived around 4:30 and then maybe four tables of people when we left.  \\nThe drinks were good and strong.  I had  crispy chicken salad, which was really good.  The chicken wasn't heavily battered and the salad had lots of different veggies.  I forgot to ask for no cheese as I'm trying to avoid dairy and they don't put any on it anyway, so I was happy.  My friend's club sandwich looked really good and he said it was. Prices were very reasonable. \\nThe bartender was low key, not super friendly but mellow.  I'd definitely recommend Fox and Hounds if you just want a mellow drink or meal, I've no idea what the later crowd is like. Well, the decor was beautiful, the food fantastic.  The bar staff was about as friendly and courteous as a plague infected rat.  Go there for the ambiance and the food, but don't except the welcoming committee...it doesn't exist there Small kitchen means you might be waiting for 4 tacos for 50 minutes on a Tuesday... that's with the bar at half capacity. I know there is a new owner and I think she would be best served by simplifying the menu. It is better to do a few things really well, than to do a lot of things slightly better than poorly. It's the only bar open for lunch in the area, they have a real opportunity to be a draw. I'll keep my fingers crossed. Worst experience ever. Just got into town & was looking for a quick meal & drink before a show downtown. This place liked decent and had customers inside, so I entered...I was gonna wet myself as I was finishing my coffee I'd been drinking during the trip so I immediately went into the restroom before making my way toward the bar (a sign in the entryway said \\\"Please seat yourself\\\" and there was no greeter). As I did a gentleman approached & said \\\"Hey man when you came in here you broke about 3 of my rules. You didn't talk to any of us, you had a backpack on, and you have a drink in your hand. Now get your ass out the door now!\\\" I tried explaining that I'd never been there so didn't know about \\\"his rules\\\", nor did I think I had to speak to anyone since the sign said seat yourself. However, anytime I tried to speak he just yelled \\\"Out the door\\\" over & over, louder & louder. Needless to say, I won't be coming here again & neither should you! Rude gay bar. I am straight and don't mind patronizing any business.  They have a beautiful bar and nice happy hour. The bartender, however, made me feel unwelcome. He was talking to other gay customers about an orgy he attended the night before. I really didn't care but decided to leave for a quieter place. After tipping him I turned to leave and he called me breeder.\\n\\nThe food menu is good. Yes, strong drinks, but do I have to deal with a rude waiter? This place should not discriminate against anyone, but I guess my Aspergers is not accepted here. I asked a couple simple questions and received rude responses and then I was targeted to receive my food last and only after I asked where my food was. Then I didn't get my bill when I asked. I won't be back if he is around. Fox and the Hounds has the honor of being my first 1 star review . If you haven't been through the gauntlet to be a regular, or aren't a rude mouthy lesbian, over the age of 40, or a desperate gay alcoholic, no reason to come here, unless you're craving bowling ally food, without the bowling ally. \\nDefinitely NOT a place everyone in the gay community can feel welcome, as a gay 20 something, I was absolutely appalled by the customer service. \\nI'm a hairstylist, so patron interactions are the single most important thing for me when it comes to my dining experience, and this was the worst I've ever had. I killed him with kindness to find the bartender had a headache, and was stressed from calling the cops on a drunk/over served 90 y/o regular.\\n I would give the place 2 stars because he wasn't feeling so great, but I have never been treated so horribly! And then another regular, a large butch women mocked me for my \\\"complicated\\\" order ( a veggie burger with no cheese or mayonnaise) I knew she was a regular because she asked about the bartenders recent vacation. \\nIt's almost laughable! How is this place still in business?! I live on the NW park blocks, and have been looking for a relaxed place to come to that wasn't the atmosphere of C.C's. Unfortunately, the search continues, and I'll make sure to let my friends and clients know where to NOT go for a good time. Wow! What has happened to Fox and Hound? I just went there for dinner, and it was horrible. First the blonde bimbo bartender was too busy talking to the three people that were at the bar but finally I ordered a drink. Told her I'd be at the table and I want to dinner. Literally the cook had to tell her that I was ready to order. I waited and waited for my salad which I asked for no onions. Finally the cook brought out my dinner and I had to tell him what about my salad. I got my salad covered in onions after my dinner was brought out. Got the chicken fried steak dinner it was so salty I could not even finish it. Then I had to go up to the bar to get my bill because she never came back over to the table. And she actually asked me \\\"oh did you have to drinks?\\\" Fox and Hound a hard no. Is this place even a gay establishment anymore? Apparently there is a new owner. She needs to work on customer service and the menu and hiring the right people. I give Fox & Hounds 4 out of 5 stars mainly because of the staff, who are very friendly and accepting of everyone. They make newcomers feel like regulars. \\n\\nIt is primarily a gay bar, but you could bring business clients there for lunch and never know it was a gay bar. Tasteful, conservative decor. Lots of straight people enjoy it as well. A good place to bring mixed sexuality groups, without making anyone feel uncomfortable. \\n\\nIf rated for their food, the score would be one star lower, I'm afraid. They rely too much on frozen, fried food. That having been said, though, their food is better than most bar food, and sometimes they really hit a home style daily special out of the park. And, their hamburgers are very reliable. Not quite gourmet burgers, but better than your average bar fare.\\n\\nThey have a Sunday brunch that is quite good if you arrive early and the food is still fresh. A friend and I stopped at this place today, Sat, Apr 26, '14, at about 3 pm.\\n\\nFood was ok, not great.  Drinks were a bit weak.\\n\\nBut the bartender (slender, about 48-49, short hair) was RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!!  No wonder there were only 3 other people there. came in here to escape the rain. drinks were strong and the bartender was great - good service and friendly. my boyfriend most definitely attracts the gay male population in portland as he got chatted up on the street numerous times, it's almost like we were attracted to this bar by divine intervention ;) I literally couldn't believe it..... Saturday of Portland Pride weekend, the place was packed, and the management had allotted ONE front of the house employee- the bartender!! \\n\\nI will never go back, because of their extremely poor showing on Pride. A gay bar? There's plenty better queer dives in this town. Horrible SERVICE! & Rude.... not personable at all... was frowned at and glared at while ordered food & i brought family in to eat and have a cocktail.. Gurllll.. shameful.. I am very very disappointed in this place! It's in a great location near CC Slaughters so you would think this place would have more business. This place could be great. Sadly the service suck! Specially the old bitch cranky bartender!  What is up with his diva attitude! He's chasing away customers and thanks to him business is going down for them! I would hope the owner would realize this place could be great with out crappy service! Just remember have a bad experience ill tell 10 people, have a great experience I will come back and bring people in! Your move! So my friend and I needed to use a bathroom bad! We popped in here and she went in while I waited my turn, the bartender came over and said \\\"we have 2 more bathrooms in back. He was so friendly we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink. I don't mind that the place was mostly a gay bar, even though we were obviously not. He was really nice and welcoming. I will definitely recommend The Fox and Hounds. Cute place and super chill. love it.  It's your total comfort food place if you ever need one.  It's a great queer place to hang out at as well.  Drinks are made strong, which is good!\\n\\nThe staff was great and the prices were pretty reasonable for the amount of food that you get!  Plus they are open super super late! A very low-key gay bar. Perfect environment for the gay community, but without the extremes. Good food, fair prices. I work right across the street from Fox & Hounds.  During the summer months when I go outside to eat my lunch I always see people from the company I work for go and eat at this establishment.  I often wondered why so many people went over there.  Is it a convenience factor?  Is the food really that good?  What gives?  Well, after all these years of working in this neighborhood I decided it was time to see what the deal was.  I took a colleague of mine out for lunch here and another gem was found.\\n\\nFirst off the food here is very affordable.  Most of their sandwiches are under $8.  This is not an $8 sandwich that you get at some of the sandwich shops in town that come with nothing and you laugh at how small it is.  This is a good sized sandwich that comes with a side (salad, fries, cup of soup?).  My colleague had heard that the Chicken Cordon Bleu ($7.25) sandwich was really good here.  That is what we both ended up ordering.  That and a few drinks (of the non-alcoholic variety as it was a work day) got me out the door for only $21.\\n\\nThe sandwich was very tasty.  The chicken was nice and moist and the bun that came along for the ride lasted throughout that ride.  I wanted to be a good boy and get a salad and was quite happy that it was pretty big.  Very good bang for your buck.\\n\\nFox & Hounds is also a bar that I believe caters mostly to the gay crowd.  Not that you have to be gay to come here.  I imagine it gets pretty lively here at nights and on weekends.  I know it as a place to get a sandwich or a burger that won't break the bank.  Now I know and knowing is half the battle. At first I thought this place looked like a spin off a rustic saloon, but then I realized it was just old and dirty. I've been here a couple times and (I hate to say it) ordered the same thing. Each time it looked completely different. Zero consistency. The bartenders are nice, but they go out for smoke breaks often and one of them had a \\\"shift drink\\\" (or shot, more like) during his shift. I see the potential, but definitely needs work. Good atmosphere and good priced drinks. Solid cheeseburger and french dip. My wife and I didn't even realize it was a gay bar until halfway through our meal. I'd go back for another french dip. It was late on a Friday night.  We were looking for a quiet place for an after-the-show get-together.  One of our friends highly recommended Fox & Hounds, stating something about the bartender always excited to them, so we took the small stroll over.\\nFrom the outside, it looked like the ambiance we were looking for.  Relaxed, pool tables in the corner for casual games, and a bat half filled with patrons.  The transition inside was not what I was expecting, which was the loud music which made things really difficult for me.  Everyone else seemed to be able to communicate just fine over the blaringly obviously iTunes playlist on shuffle that played on the speaker system; for me though, I just gave up taking part of any conversation and just wish the night would end and go home. Used to like this place. New owners, new name. The rainbow flag is gone. Using the restroom requires asking for a key attached to a ridiculously large tchatchke. The tchatchke was disgustingly filthy. Like using the restroom at a Texaco. I ordered the fish and chips. The menu said ling cod. I got frozen Atlantic cod. Major difference. The coleslaw was old enough to vote, it was rotten and translucent. My husband got the Cordon Bleu. He still smells like onions. ONIONS! The fries were ok, large steak fries but the ketchup was obviously married and I didn't want to play shigellosis roulette. A sports themed bar with shitty food is really the last thing Old town/Chinatown needs at this point. Especially one that ignores the neighborhood demographics. Good luck Second Ave Sports Bar, you're gonna need it. Giving this place 5 stars because there is a new owner that is working hard to make things better. It is worth coming down again to check out since I think most people have forgotten about this place. Menu has been slimmed down to a more manageable selection. Food service at this time is still a little slow to get out orders. This is a bit of a problem during the weekday lunch hour since most people downtown are on a schedule and need to get in and out and back to work.  I think after a few of the kinks and growing pains are worked out this will be a downtown hangout worth coming back to. Came in yesterday for a quick drink before catching the train to the airport. Quiet, local gay bar. I encountered a nice bartender who pointed me in the right direction to the train stop, so I'm kind of surprised by the negative Yelp reviews as I didn't experience anything remotely like what I've read. Very fun, good food, casual, just up the street from more touristy places. Friendly crowd and staff. Beautifully remodeled, nice and dimly lit with a warm and cozy atmosphere complemented with friendly and attitudeless service.   I find this place great for relaxing with a beer and a shot after work.  Far cry from yesteryear when the establishment was frequented by loud over weight, unattractive, tweakers/drunks with personalities equal to that of underwatered houseplants.  Good moderately priced menu.  I would frequent this place more often if the pool table was less than seventy-five cents per game......or even  free!! Ate here before and enjoyed it, returned recently and I gotta say putting a sticker on your menu saying \\\"due to mimimum wage increases everything on the menu is +$1\\\" is also saying \\\"I'd literally pay my workers less than this if the government would let me\\\" or \\\"I don't care about my employees, so they won't care about the quality of your food.\\\" \\nNever coming back and advising other to not eat here! This is a quiet, relaxing place.  I like that!  If you're looking for loud music and a raucous atmosphere, this isn't the place for you.  But it's a very pleasant place with reasonable prices on food and drink.  Just one word of advice..  if you order steak or prime rib, ask for it to be cooked rare.  They seem to overcook the beef here until it's dry and tasteless. I have had really bad experience here.. But I am updating my review based on my experience with a bartender named Matt... Really awsome... Visit the ba when he is around! This is a nice place to grab a sandwich and a draft beer. Gay friendly, but not all gay. We went on a monday (yesterday eve). It was Labor Day, not crowded at about 5:30pm. My first time there. I got the rueben sandwich and a salad (instead of fries). Salad was crisp and fresh, rueben was good but note that there is very little meat in the sandwich but it was still ok. It was $8 or $7.something.  A friend got the mac and cheese with bacon. A lot of food and very good, but a tad pricey at $9. The 3rd in our group got the Monday special: a small steak, baked potato, brocolli, and side salad all for $9,50. Very good deal. The service was VERY slow. The bartender was also the server. He was busy talking with the two guys sitting at the bar or going outside to smoke to give us any decent service. But who is in a rush? Glad we weren't. So don't get the rueben til they start putting more meat but the other meals, the atmosphere, all worth it. h and maybe don't go on mondays...get a different server that way. we had a rough week, and had been meaning to come here for some time. we came for lunch 12-22-12. began with a bloody mary, and a corona. next, i chose the veggie s. and m. burger on wheat with a salad and oil/vinegar. my partner had the traditional s. and m. burger with fries. the drinks hit the spot, and the food was delicious. our server/bartender was the best...he was so efficient, funny, friendly, and very customer-focused...we will be back...thx so much... Atmosphere here is great, there is a pool table for those that are interested.  My server was very friendly and funny. My only complaint (which is kinda silly), is the well vodka is foul.  I'm not a picky drinker and order well often, but I ordered a drink and a friend did also, both of us could barely choke it down.  Neither were made incorrectly... they were definitely what we ordered, but the vodka was a little odd... almost bitter.  I can't really fault the establishment though, because you can simply choose another brand of vodka; I would recommend they look into switching that out though and again, I'm really not picky with that stuff.  We will definitely be back! I have gone a couple of time in the past year to Fox & Hounds (little bar/food joint) because it is conveniently located near my job.  It's a dive but I continue to go.  Everytime I go the service is late.  This last time I went is the LAST time I will ever go!!!  Let me break it down for you...\\n\\nI walk in and the waiter (they only have one) looks me directly in the face as I walk myself to a booth.  He continues to take care of the table he is serving at the time.  He walks around the bar and walks behind the bar and gets their drinks ready.  He continues to go back to their table with their drinks and will not look at me...keep in mind I'm right behind him.  He walks back to give the cook their orders and then walks behind the bar to chitchat w/the barflies.  I'm staring him down the WHOLE time.  He then goes and gets their food from the cook area.  At that time I go and get my own menu!  I walk back to my booth and he's right behind me!!!  He serves that last table with their food and goes back behind the bar to chitchat.  Finally...20 minutes later he comes over as if nothing is wrong.  He has stupid smile on his face like he knows he should apologize!!!  But he doesn't!  By this time my date (fiance) had shown up and we order.  By the time we are get our food we eat a couple of bites and have to box it up and leave!  Never once did he apologize or anything.  I have, like I said, been to this place a couple of times and every time I feel like I don't get the service that I deserve!!! Cheap good food.  Besides just being across the street from work, the best part about going there is Jeff, the bartender.  LOVE him.  I've only been there for lunch during work, so I haven't tried any drinks, but the food is good for bar food. DO NOT GO HERE\\n\\n(To the owner, feel free to get in contact with us)\\n\\nseriously we used to be regulars and have gone to this bar for over a DECADE!\\n\\nThis is the last time we will ever go to this bar. \\nYou had many chances and disappointed our group every Sunday for the last couple months.\\n\\nIt's Sunday and we called around 2pm, told them a large group of us will be showing up again. (usually ends up being around 10-15 people, plus others who join us and some who leave during our regular meet-ups) They told us they would be open their POSTED HOURS.\\n\\n(That means you were supposed to be open until 11 every Sunday night)\\n\\n we got there and the lights were off and doors locked, it's now only 6:50pm.\\n\\nThe last time we all tried to meet here, (we meet every Sunday here around 7pm) they told us they were no longer serving food for the day because the grill kept catching fire. (Ok I guess)\\n\\nBut then we ordered fried food and eventually (after three orders of only being able to choose from french fries or tater tots, are you kidding me!?) they told us they were no longer doing fried food either!\\n\\nI'm more then sure at this point, as is the rest of the group, they just didn't want to make food.\\n\\nThey closed an hour and half EARLY last Sunday\\nAn hour early the Sunday prior. \\nAnd many times before that.\\n\\nI work in the service industry, I UNDERSTAND wanting to go home, however I suck it up since I chose the field and job. I work 50/60+ hours a week so I really really understand that. But as a manager who covers shifts and volunteers to close, no matter how slow it might get, I ALWAYS stay open. ALWAYS have everything stocked and KNOW my inventory!\\n\\nIF ITS ON THE MENU,  YOU SERVE IT. PERIOD.\\n\\nDONT LET YOUR KITCHEN STAFF COME UP TO THE FRONT OF THE BAR COMPLAINING THAT SOMEONE GOT THEM SWISHER SWEETS INSTEAD OF SOME OTHER CIGARETTES WHILE CURSING LOUDY IN FRONT OF YOUR GUESTS.\\n\\nHOLY MOLY LADY! GOSH HECKIE YOUR STAFF IS A JOKE. \\n\\nFrom one business owner to another. The biggest regret I had when I bought my restaurant was not letting go of staff members who kept dragging it down and had repeated customer service issues. (Everyone gets a second chance) Eventually I let them go and I actually saw a lot of my regulars returning to me. \\n\\nYou should probably let some people go and start covering shifts yourself. Who knows, you might get customers back. \\n\\nI hope other customers step up and complain so you know what the in the world is going on at your bar.\\n\\nGet your staff and your service back in order.\\n\\nYou have lost a large group of customers and although we will be open to talking about a bunch of issues, we will not be returning to this bar again. That's a minimum of 10+ people your staff has alienated. I always knew Fox & Hounds to be a gay dive bar on the level that the Dirty Duck was, so I never really gave it a chance.  Recently a colleague of mine said she loved to go there after work, which I found odd given how I just described the place.  But yesterday I found myself there for some pool and cheap drinks (Hot Toddies for $5.50) and a friendly crowd.   \\n\\nTo me it still seems apparently gay, but I guess I'm a little more in tune with the cues.  My straight colleagues still enjoy themselves, as it should be.  It doesn't feel divey or dirty at all, probably due to their recent remodel.  I know I'll be back here for drinks with co-workers and some good games of pool. F&H is an unassuming sexless gay bar, where they pour cheap, strong drinks, the regulars are hardcore drinkers and the decor and  lighting are atrocious (akin to a Shari's). Fried food, bad music,  tube TV's and video poker add to the ambiance. \\n\\nIn sum, it's too brightly lit,  the vibe is lackluster, the dicks are limp but the drinks ARE stiff.\\n\\nL'Chaim! I'm feeling nice so giving them three stars because things turned around in the last year for me here. I've often wondered what I need to do in order to get half decent service here. It's taken me nearly five years and they treat me better, but still, worse than Denny's.\\n\\nThanks for having such a big menu, there are some edible things on it, which is more than most gay places in this town. I've got stories though... Moldy fried food, and a taco with a raw corn tortilla? Imagine trying to eat that?\\n\\nI go there because my friends who have been around longer go there and they have more money, flirt with the staff and tip them big. I guess that's how it's done... Echoing what the previous reviewers said...total dive bar.  However,  I had a really great experience there and plan on going back when I come back to Portland.  The staff were all friendly and attentive, my drink did not stay empty long without one of the servers asking if I needed another (yes please!).  The drinks themeselves were strong and cheap (ahhh the way I like em!), the food was decent considering the dive-y-ness of the place, the music was fun and the patrons were also friendly and a lot of fun.  There were four of us in our party, and we escaped with plenty of drinks and nibbles for under $60.00, which was worth an additional star. I have been going to the Fox and Hound for over 20 years and always had a good time and ran into lots of friend.  WHAT HAPPENED!!!  Does not feel like a gay bar anymore and Friday nights are dead!  What happened to our friendly bartender- Joe.  Always had great service and a good time.  The last 2 Fridays were horrible!!!! Don't know if I will go back! I have been to the Fox and Hounds a few times and have never been disappointed. I am not a \\\"sit at the bar type a guy\\\" so all my experience comes from sitting at the normal tables. The food, drinks, and service has always been extremely good. As with any place, challenges do arise. However, the one time that it did, the staff was extremely apologetic and took care of the problem right away. As with all the other reviews, the place is beautiful and very inviting to all. Thank you, Fox and Hounds. I will definitely keep coming back. I went here to meet someone for brunch.  To my surprise it was pretty nice.  I had an omelet and coffee for $8.which is a really low price for what you get.\\n\\nThe waiter was a bit absent minded, but it kind of gave the place character.  \\n\\nThe place is a staple low cost place to eat for the local gay community.\\n\\nThis is located just one block from the Chinatown/downtown stop on the Red or Blue MAX light rail trains. Always a favorite place for a good, solid, simple weekend breakfast without the Portland brunch wait. Excellent service. Generous cocktails. Affordable. And, yes, it's a gay bar but we straights are made perfectly welcome. Super nice people. And yes, you may have to maneuver around a couple of street people, but that's Old Town Portland. All good! When I say we get around.. we get around.. ;) Stopped in here Friday night after we couldn't get into the other place we planned so we had to pass the place we were supposed to go and ended up in this place. Had a few drinks in here, the atmophere was nice and friendly. Had a great time just kicking back and having a few. While I would have liked to go dancing.. thats ok.. I can be just as at home in a place like this if not more. \\n\\nI love pursuing downtown when you don't have a car to worry about.. you just from place to place and then you figure out where to catch the max and go home! So much easier and you frequent lots of bars that way too. Just walk from one to the next.. no problem! Would go in here again. They really do look after thier customers! Fox & Hounds is one of those places that's set off from the main path and once you find it, you're glad it is. The atmosphere is pleasant even when it's filled with regulars. It's a great place to grab a beer or a bite and read a book or just be alone with your thoughts but it's also a great place to gather with friends. \\n\\nService is prompt and efficient and provided by a warm, friendly staff. I've never felt rushed here even when they're visibly busy. You're given the feeling that you are your servers' or bartenders' only customer and these days, that kind of service is a rare find. \\n\\nThe menu is descriptive and offers better than the average bar fare. Try the Mac n Cheese with bacon...creamy goodness served with your choice of soup or salad. Generous portions so anticipate taking half your meal home with you. \\n\\nDrinks are cheap and strong. I know what you're thinking, nuff said! This place sucks. I asked for shots for my friends and was told that the bartender didn't \\\"feel like making shots\\\" so we were only allowed beers. What kind of bar does that? He also told us that if we ended up at his bar, we were probably kicked out of a club nearby. Not true at all for our crew, but I guess that's the type of crowd this bar attracts...\\n\\nNo wonder this bar is huge and only has two people other than us on a Friday night. After my second offensive attempt to have a drink at CC's (see my review), I discovered this gem of a bar.  I can't recommend it enough.\\n\\nNice decor, super bartender's, hot looking AND friendly customers, and an above par drink.\\n\\nWhat more can you ask for? Havent been here in awhile. Found out its under new management. Prices are still low drinks are still good. New menu. New pool tables.Gotta love this place. Like with any gay bar in Portland, don't expect attentiveness on your first few visits - unless you are really cute. Bartenders are efficient, not unfriendly and pour a good drink. The beer taps are probably pretty average for Portland and likely will provide something palatable for discerning beer drinkers. \\n\\nIf you hang around the bar a bit you'll notice that the bartenders and some of the regular customers can get rather catty at times - particularly when the odd unknowing group of apparently straight people walk in the door. This can be off-putting or enjoyable depending on your tastes. However, it all seems pretty harmless and just in fun.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty comprehensive and VERY inexpensive. I have tried a few items on the menu and been impressed with the quality. The cook is really very good.  \\n\\nThe place is comfortable, there are several TVs. Don't expect to catch the latest sporting event though. Fine by me. \\n\\nIt really is a nice place to check out particularly with a group of friends. Grab a table if you are seeking a semi-private conversation. Sit at the bar if you enjoy eaves-dropping on (or participating in) the cattiness. Fox & Hounds has been a starting place, mid-party rehydration station, and last stop to some of my best evenings in Portland.  The place is dark and divy, but the staff are always friendly and cheerful.  They make a STRONG long island which is a necessity on any night out in Portland.  It is within walking distance to events like Blow Pony and places like CC Slaughters and Whiskey Bar.  In the middle of the night when you and your friends need a mini break from the party, another drink, and a clean bathroom, go to Fox & Hounds.  Pull up a chair, share a drink, and get a little quality chat time in with your friends before rejoining the party. If you want a place to dine that is fabulous in all areas, make your way to Fox And Hounds.  Great food and fabulous people. Wow!!!!! I posted some photos of Rick and Jeff. These guys make a restaurant experience memorable  Thanks Rick for the awesome service Can't believe the service tonight.  Girl behind the bar seemed off possibly on something or had been drinking.  It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to to get a drink or bottle of beer. We usually come in on Saturday nights and the bartender who has worked there for years and should be experienced is slow and more interested in idle chit chat than serving customers! Leaving won't be back! First time here, and my last. Sat at the bar, and was forced to witness the drunken owner verbally abuse and humiliate his staff in front of a a bar full of customers. As a customer service business owner myself, I was shocked to see an owner behave this way. I heard from a regular customer seated next to me that this happens often here, and that they can't keep staff as a result. I'm surprised this place hasn't been busted by the OLCC since the owner is drunk while on the premises. The food was good, though, and the staff did their best, given who they have to work for. This place has solid food and the the new owner is proactive to to say the least. and I know they've been going through a lot of changes. I've worked in the industry long enough to know things get weird and unpredictable. It's a good bar don't bitch about food issues. If you can't afford a nice brunch or steak at real restaurant that doesn't those things don't bitch about the BAR you are sitting in. Have a drink chill out...Jim... maybe have a more understanding humble point of view...coming from a church goer.\",\n          \"Beer menu is limited but decent, food items are fresh and delicious. Ambient is comfy and spacious, prices are OK for the area. Great FL Beer selection. Friendly bar service and nice fresh vegetables to go. I like this place a lot! We have had beer so many times from here. But honestly we get wine and charceuterie from la femme de Fromage. Unfortunately they disappointed us so we sat at Florida and co. Wonderful experience with perky staff (Jennifer) and good alternative food option from houndstooth The food is amazing. The drinks are great craft brews and mimosas. The environment is chill and relaxing! Great place Friendly staff, locally grown and produced products, craft beer and even personal hygiene products... What more can you ask for? Cute bar too! Nice little local hotspot inside East End Market just as you enter. The beautiful natural wood counter invites their customers in to their bar stool seating. The staff are welcoming and knowledgeable on their only local ingredients menu. To be honest, we only came for the drinks menu, but they do serve what looks to be delicious food.\\nMy other half ordered their very affordable beer flight, which included 5 beer samples for just $10! I on the other hand orders their Shrub which is a flavored vinegar with sparking wine or water. Let's just say he got the better end of the deal. Even though their options for beer are limited on draft, the options were tasty. As for me, I should've just stuck with me gut and gotten wine. The Bees Knees with sparkling water was boring. It tasted like just like water at first then a sour honey at the end. I gave it another try with their Mayhaw Berry option, which wasn't any better. To tart for my taste unfortunately.\\nNeedless to say I'm sure we will be back for their beer flight again and just avoid the Shrubs and order their food the next go around. Shout out to Florida & Co for repping the sunshine state HARD! From locally sourced ingredients, to brews from all over our lovely state- this spot is showcasing the flavors of all the fun under the Florida sun.\\n\\nDavid was awesome - and helped to prepare a great Beer Flight for me. From stouts to ciders, I got a chance to try 5 different beers. My two favorites were the Apple Cider from Keel and Curly as well as the Key Lime Beer from Key Billy. \\n\\nI also had a chance to try the Shrimp and Grits my momma ordered. This was as hearty as you'd expect a shrimp and grits to be, but not as decadent as your traditional southern preparation. \\n\\nMade with coconut oil instead of butter, the bowl of grits was topped with hearty portions of shrimp, greens, peppers and onions. It was so flavorful and almost too pretty to eat!\\n\\nThis spot has high top tables and a good amount of bar seating, but they'll also bring your food outside if you decide to dine al fresco.\\n\\nThey've also got a good selection of wines - even some wine on tap! They offer flights of wine as well which is fun. We discovered this little gem while waiting to  get into Domu. We took the server's suggestion, ordered a beer off their featured list and got the small plate Red Snapper Ceviche w/ plaintain chips (idk why it says chips, they were delicious, juicy and thick like normal fried plantains). I thought the ceviche was kind of sharp/acidic but my boyfriend loved it. Definitely recommend the ceviche on top of the plaintain to cancel out some of the acidity (even if it is a bit hard to scoop).\\n\\nCant wait to visit again! : ) A place you can buy local groceries and drink local beer and wine too?! What a unique concept!\\n\\nI haven't drank here yet, but I am very familiar with many of the brews they have on tap and sold as bottles. They are all high quality craft beers, all of which look to be brewed right here in Florida. One side of their grocery counter acts as a bar, where about 5 people can sit and enjoy their beer. You'll also see people sitting outside drinking too.\\n\\nSo far I have only bought a dozen eggs here, picked locally, for $4 a dozen. These are the same eggs you might have seen at the Audubon Park Farmers market. Browsing through their selection, they also have all local arugula, lettuces, heirloom tomatoes, squashes, and frozen meats. Plus spices and bottles of vanilla.\\n\\nI'm looking forward to having a cold local beer here one of these days. Went for the first time two days ago and was extremely impressed!  The pesto meatballs over zucchini \\\"pasta\\\" was fabulous as well as the ceviche, which was equally good.  It was great to be able to drink a grapefruit mimosa with fresh grapefruit pulp in it.  Yummy.  The decor and ambiance was steller!  I highly recommend. Great beer election, very helpful staff. They also have a variety of different products ranging from produce to beard cleanser to vanilla extracts. If you are in Orlando, you absolutely must visit the East End Market and stop by Local Roots. Love east end market overall as a whole but the service at Florida & Co beer was not good at all. We sat,  the guy working took several minutes just to greet us and when he did it wasn't friendly..as if we were a bother. There were only 2 other patrons and he engaged them 100% of the time, non-stop talking  about himself and his plans.  Very disappointing as I'm a local and visit this place often. One should engage, conversation with all customers,  be friendly to all. Thankfully there are other great local shops here with excellent customer service! Florida & Co. is the first place (on the left) when you walk in the front entrance at East End Market.  It used to be called Local Roots, but has been going through a branding change.  My husband and I ordered brunch from  Farm Haus (at the back left of East End) and then sauntered over to the bar at Florida & Co.\\n\\nWe were quickly greeted by two staff members that saw us eyeing their draft menu.  They provided recommendations based on the types of beers we like and my husband and I both ended up with drafts that we enjoyed.  The staff said that we could sit at their counter and eat/drink or we could wander around East End Market with our beers, no need to feel stuck there.  As we were waiting on our food to be ready, we took a seat at the bar there, and remained there eating once we got our food.\\n\\nThe offer locally sourced items such as meat, beer, body products, and honey.  Some of the items seemed a bit pricey to me, but others were what I expected at any market or grocery store.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and chatty with those the customers that were also chatty.  Overall, a great first beer at Florida & Co.  I'm sure we will continue to check out what they have on tap during our visits to the Market. This is an awesome place to find Florida local items. I love shopping small and shopping local, and this place kills two birds with one stone, as it were. They have everything from local craft beers to t-shirts that let you showcase your local love with a great shirt!\\n\\nI'll be headed back to snatch up the honey butter in the cold case. Couldn't take it on my last visit since I wasn't headed home, and it needs to be kept cool.\\n\\nThe staff greeted my sister and I right away and offered help on anything we wanted more info on. I also fell in love with the local roots t-shirt that had the Orlando city skyline on it. \\n\\nOverall: A\\nThis place rocks. I love local stuff and this place has it all! Amazing first experience. Ordered the Southern spicy with Florida white shrimp with a soft egg. Was extremely delicious, I was licking the bowl. Had the right balance of citrus and spice! What can I say it was delicious. Located at the front of the East End Market, Local Roots Farm Store offers a nice selection of items. Greens, veggies, farm fresh eggs, meats and nice locally made pantry items like Mannix Vanilla, grits and home and bath products. \\n\\nThe beautiful wood bar offers up a nice spot to enjoy Quantum Leap wines and Florida brewed craft beers. (Including Cask & Larder) Try a flight and sample your way through some great wines or craft brews. Local Roots offers wifi and a spot to sit down to enjoy your delicious sandwich from Hounds Tooth or maybe La Bretxa. Service is attentive and warm, if you prefer to soak up the beautiful Florida day, it's OK to take your glassware outside to the picnic tables or enjoy the courtyard. I love East End Market and Local Roots is one of the tenant merchants that help cement that love! This is the store that helps make EEM a market. I am able to stop by, pick up some bread, local meat, eggs, and a bottle of something fun!\\n\\nAs previous reviews have mentioned, LR has a fabulous wooden counter that you can sit at while sipping on local wine and beer (sometimes they even have rare brews!). I've also sat there having a coffee from Lineage when EEM was fairly empty and they had no problem with this. \\n\\nThey carry various seasonal greens, local organic meat & poultry, eggs ($4/dozen~ I can dig those prices!), locally-made greeting cards, lotions & elixirs, etc. I always get my eggs here now since they are so cheap and who can beat local, free-range eggs? No one. That's who.\\n\\nBut what always keeps me coming back is the service (isn't it  always that?). The person behind the counter is always incredibly nice and always seems genuinely interested in the customer. Last time I was there I bought some eggs, mentioned that they were for my sister's after-wedding brunch, and the woman gushed to my sister and wished her so much happiness and love. It was so nice and more than just a quick 'congrats.' \\n\\ntl;dr - Great eggs, great service = 5 stars Great selection of local and regional beers on tap and they have a sampler platter my favorite! The good service others rave about was absent during my recent weekend morning visit. A buddy and I sat down to eat food from the bakery across the hall - it was already 82 degrees at 11 a.m. and we didn't want to eat outside. \\n\\nThe Local Roots \\\"bartender\\\" said he only had beer and wine. No cold non-alcoholic drinks. He filled a pitcher with warm tap water (no ice), poured us each a glass and then put the pitcher out of reach. We downed the waters quickly - we'd been out biking - and started at our empty glasses while he spent five minutes counting coins in his coin box.\\n\\nNot wanting to be a pain I waited a while before getting up, walking over, and asking for a refill. He obliged - and then put the warm water pitcher out of reach again before walking off to adjust the twine holding the price tag to the kale basket at the back of the store. Same thing again, staring at empty glasses. There were 0-2 other customers in the store this whole time. \\n\\nI understand that we were not paying customers, but the bartender lost a chance to build goodwill and attract a future customer that would evangelize for a business that looks like it needs all the evangelism it can get. What would I have done in his shoes?\\n\\n- Poured the pitcher and then left it for us to \\\"self serve,\\\" freeing him to other duties\\n\\n- Gotten ice for the pitcher without putting the customer in the awkward position of being the 'I am only here drinking free water, and now you're asking me if you should walk across the building on my account for some ice' guy\\n\\n- Poured a couple little taster glasses of beer and slipped them in front of us unbidden. If we turn them down, the bartender just wasted 50 cents of product. If we drink them, he's got customers for life. (\\\"Hey! I'm that bartender's best friend! He just gave me a free beer!) Local Roots, you better clear out a permanent stool at your bar for me. I love your variety of all things Florida. From carrying local beers and wines to handmade hards and deli items. Aside from the eye catching wooden bar, the unique wooden taps truly draw a passerby's attention in. While we were a bit disappointed that we couldn't score a space at the bar to enjoy our Original Sin Pear Cider, we were more than happy to get some vitamin D with our brew at one of the outdoor picnic tables. \\n\\nI could reiterate all the positive things that the reviewers before me touched upon, but what stood out in my mind is the supremely chill vibe given off by the gents running the counter. They were helpful and very efficient despite every seat being taken at the bar. I loved the homemade feeling of everything, like I was welcomed at the counter in their personal kitchen. The chalkboard with the tap listing was a bit small, but it was effective in drawing us up to the counter to take a closer look. \\n\\nI hope I can time my next visit better, so I can pick the brains of the staff and learn more about their business. Those visiting EEM, make this a pitstop on your list whether you're buying a beverage or finding something deliciously local to take home with you. We fancied ourselves a beer while munching on our grilled cheese from La Femme du Fromage (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-femme-du-fromage-orlando?hrid=6G5cYcOnpwibl63Eib6mCA) and Local Roots was able to fill that need. With local beers on tap & the option to get a flight we were able to taste several beers from around the Sunshine State. \\n\\nLoved the wooden bar! Such a cool design. While we didn't purchase anything on this visit, I did love perusing the wares of the shop and thinking about what I might need to pick up next time. If I lived around the corner in the neighborhood, this would be the perfect place to stop to pick up something for dinner. \\n\\nThe gentleman behind the bar was super friendly and didn't rush us in any way even as the crowd started to pick up around lunch time. There's plenty of seating (~15 stools) at the bar so you shouldn't have too hard a time finding a place to sit. Absolutely love this cute and local vendor at East End Market! Florida & Co. serves local craft beers as well as wine and sparkling cocktails. I'm excited to try their food menu next. Apparently you get 25% off your tab when you eat dinner here, even alcohol. Do yourself a favor and try the shrubs. It sounds weird, but they are so good. They are more of an elixir that they mix with sparkling soda or champagne. I loved the hibiscus and Mayhan the best. And if you're looking to try a different wine or beer offered, go for the flights. They are a great deal. You can bring your drinks around the market or even go outside and listen to the live band that might be there. Or just sit at the bar and enjoy some friendly conversation with Emily and Perrin. One of my favorite dishes is shrimp & grits.  The dish as prepared  by Florida & Co offers a delicious healthier option to the traditional southern dish.  Not the less in flavor, it is prepared with coconut oil and adds Swiss chard and kale along with savory shrimp and an egg on top. The ingredients are locally sourced and are fresh   It is a dish worth repeating.  The setting is so nice. You can eat outside or inside at counter seating. They serve wine and also some craft beers on draft. I Can't wait for the next time I'm visiting the area to stop in at East end Market to try it again. Florida & Co is so good it will change your mind about Orlando. It proves it's more than a city just centered around touristy Disney World and full of gross, fried food. WRONG! \\n\\nFlorida & Co is a locally sourced restaurant inside the cool East End Market that prioritizes low sugar foods. On top of that, they sell some of Florida's best craft beer and ciders.\\n\\nI ordered the Mojo bowl or lunch with brown rice, kale, sweet peppers, orange slices, and Florida wild shrimp. It was all steamed and came with a light lime garlic sauce. It was so good, healthy, and balanced the flavors well (the orange slices were perfect and, yes, you are meant to eat the orange peel).\\n\\nThe drink list is really good and they always have a local cider on tap. I ordered the acai cider from Accomplice Brewery and it was one of the best drinks I've ever had.\\n\\nOn top of that, the space is beautiful with a few tables off to the side and a long wood bar to sit at. Also, the service is excellent and friendly! Claim to be a small craft brewery specialist, doesn't even know the difference between white IPA and a pale ale... food is pretty good but owner is incompetent, decent experience but made it hard to enjoy a beer due to bad attitude. Stick too food here This place is a wonderful staple in the East end market. The last few times I've been here have been as a layover type visit- while waiting on a table at Domu or just for cheese (from the fromage) and beer but I need to change that as their menu has expanded and looks rather tasty AND healthy. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the local craft beers they have and are always willing to let you sample something before you decide. The bar front seating can be limited but they are more than willing to let you sit outside with drinks and will deliver food to you outside as well. I came here a few weekends ago with friends and it was so amazing! It's located inside East End Market so a great place to hangout on a Saturday or Sunday morning. They have ample seating space, extremely friendly employees, and a menu full of feel-good, delicious meals and snacks. I ordered the Florida Bowl with Shrimp. It did take a few minutes to prepare, but I was the first customer of the morning and they prepared everything fresh which was nice. The bowl began with a bed of rice, a hearty portion of greens, ample pickled vegetables, and a deliciously light cilantro-lemongrass sauce. Four or five large shrimp adorned the top of the bowl. \\n\\nI absolutely loved this! First of all, it was piping hot and extra comforting on a rainy morning. At $15 a bowl, you really get a perfect sized portion-- enough to feel like you've got your money's worth, but not simply loaded with cheap fillers. The cilantro-lemongrass sauce was truly a standout. A lot of times I order things with sauce on the side because they're too often heavy handed in the application, or way too oily. There was just the right amount of sauce added to this bowl and it wasn't loaded down with weird oils. Absolutely wonderful-- highly recommend! I was really excited to come to this place to try some ceviche. I'm not sure if it was the advertising , but it looks delicious. Surely enough it was. However their is always more then one aspect to a dining experience! Let's take it from the top! \\n\\nI'd like to start with the parking. Which you have to acknowledge as lackluster. It is understandable, for a market that shares space with several different kinds of businesses. However, space is available right outside of East End as it does tend to fill up quickly and for many hours on end. All within a short walking distance and free. No worries! \\n\\nFlorida and Co is located right up front on your left as soon as you enter. The aesthetic immediately captures your attention and if seafood is your thing, then it will also captures your tastebuds. Upon seating ourselves and reviewing the menus. We ordered 2 waters which were filled a quarter full each time (including the one refill). I'm not sure if that is part of the experience or not. No big deal, I finally settled upon ordering the ceviche bowl and anxiously awaited as I contained my growling stomach! \\n\\nMy favorite time arrived as I received my food within minutes and was extremely excited to eat this meal. I went with the jasmine rice option as well and really hoped for a nice heaping bowl of ceviche for $15. To my dismay, I received the bowl, minus the heaping. It turned out to be enough food for about half the actual size of the bowl. In all fairness, the food was absolutely delicious. The fish was very fresh and the acidity and lime really work well together in the ceviche. The onions are proportionate and the jasmine rice is to die for. \\n\\nA restaurant is much more than a food establishment though, it is at its heart. A service based business. I would like to mention Kristen as a very nice and helpful employee. I say this because Kristen turned out to be the only one their that morning who actually put on a nice friendly smile and sought to uphold the customer service standard. Aside from that, I must note that the service in general was bad. After paying for my purchase and putting the tablet on the table for my girlfriend to pay for her meal, the  employee across from us snatched the tablet and gives it to a couple next to me, forcing us to awkwardly wait for someone to check out before us in the middle of us checking out. That was really uncomfortable for me. I still left a tip because I appreciate the hard work small business go through and just want to show my support in anyway possible. \\n\\n\\nOverall, the food is good here. I don't warn anyone against going here. If ceviche or seafood is your thing, you might want to go for it. As for me, Unfortunately, I will not be back, but I do have high hopes for the future of this business! Their food is just amazing. Have you ever had the first bite of something and literally say \\\"OH MY GOD\\\" this is so good and just be in  over it? Lol yeah this places does that to me every time. Everyone who works there is also super nice and helpful. Love love love. If you haven't tried it you MUST! Every time I hit up East End, I always go to Gideon's and Domu. But this time I finally gave the other spots a try, which led me to the zucchini noodle bowl at Florida & Co. they're clearly capitalizing on the fad diets of New Years Resolutions, which is fine by me! The zucchini was crunchy and it soaked up that great pecan pesto sauce. Topped it with their homemade meatballs and red sauce, and I was in heaven. The bowl packed flavor and savor and it satisfied my pasta needs. We came here for another establishment but on our way out of this indoor farmers market type place we made a pit stop. My husband tried a sample of the Central 28, Upriver American Pale Ale 6%. He enjoyed it so much he went ahead and got a glass for $7.00. \\n\\nI will say their beer pairs well with Gideons cookies. 5 Stars for all of the reasons mentioned in my prior review and now some fabulous prepared food!\\n\\nThere's still the local beers, locally made products, and tasty wines, but what was once Local Roots is now Florida & Co., and it provides another great option for prepared food at East End Market.\\n\\nI took a seat at one of their round high top tables and ordered the (local meat) meatball sandwich and a rice bowl of pickled veggies, lettuce, and shrimp. Of course, I forgot to take a picture of the menu, so I don't have the official names of these dishes, but it seems like anything you order off this menu is going to be quality and full of flavor.\\n\\nThe meatball sandwich was hearty and had enough acidity to leave you feeling light afterwards. Which is the first time I can remember feeling that after a meatball sub. The rice bowl had thinly sliced pickled cucumbers, carrots, and beautiful lettuce leaves (I want to say butter lettuce, but I'm not great at identifying greens...). But the star of the dish was the shrimp. There were plenty of perfectly seasoned shrimp (no poop vein!) and a bite of pickled vegetables with shrimp is flavor perfection!\\n\\nService was great (thanks, David!) and the round tables gave more privacy for lunch meetings than when you used to only have the bar as an option. There's not as much selection in terms of produce or local gifts, but that's been replaced with really, really good food. So, overall, a great change!\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1075,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Cleaned Review\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The sandwich was made well and delivery was fast.  Can't comment on customer service since I just ordered online for delivery.  I would order again if I'm working in the area again. This Jimmy Johns is the worst that I've been to and I frequent them a lot. The staff are not friendly and the subs are very thin, not worth the money. Food tastes as expected (what you want from a chain). Took close to forty minutes and I was a mile away - not freaky fast. The beach club is my favorite! Awful! I ordered my food at 11:05 and didn't receive it until 1:40. Customer service was awful. The service here was horrible.  Staff is very unfriendly!  I had to tell the girl 3 times before she got my order correct and then she acted like it was my fault.  I will not be coming back.  The jalape\\u00f1o chips are good but their tuna tasted like it died a slow painful death. \\\"Freaky Slow\\\" should be this locations motto. I ordered online and 15 minutes before arriving to the store and when I got here I had to wait another 15. Very poorly managed store, absolutely ridiculous, they even have a huge staff on hand. Ok let's start by say the loud music as if I'm walking into a night club. Then I look at the menu before I get to the cash register and I stand the for a minute before I say something to the guy that is standing there and refuse to face me to take my order WTH. Then he whispers do you want cheese on that and I said yes, come to find out I was charged extra for the cheese. WHAT IS A SANDWICH WITHOUT DARN CHEESE SMH IM DONE WITH PLACE. Now for the group of employees that make the place look like a hang out spot IM DONE DROPPING THE MIC My wife and I are here with out 2 yr old son.  We each ordered a sandwich and began to eat, feeding our son from our own sandwich.  We quickly realised he was only interested in the bread so went up to grab a day old bread for 50 cents. The kind gentlemen behind the counter asked if it was for the little guy and gave it to him for free, asking if we needed any sauces on it for him.  Give the place a shot; what a kind, selfless thing to do! Nice refreshing change of pace from the old fast food burger joints. My wife and I order from here regularly. The app works great for us and the delivery is always really fast.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are always correctly put together and the quality is great. You definitely get what you pay for. \\n\\nAs a suggestion, I always ask them to \\\"take some bread out\\\" when ordering the French bread, it helps to eat the sandwhich without losing the goods. What I don't understand how people manage to hire employees with bad attitudes and let them be the face of a business.3 employees working with no smile, no greeting and bad attitude like someone killed their cat. \\nWalked up to the counter and I get greeted with \\\"whatchu want\\\". Ordered a sub an Asked for a cup of water, got a dreadful reply \\\"we are out of water cups\\\" with absolutely no sense of remorse, let alone a \\\"sorry\\\". It's like I am not giving them business, they are doing me a favor by serving me.\\nIf you hate your jobs so much, don't spoil your customer's mood with bad attitude. Go find another job or leave your f-ing attitude at home. I ordered 2 sandwiches to be delivered. 45 mins later? I'm still waiting. Apparently the B Team is working because it would have absolutely faster to drive there myself, eat, and drive back. If you order delivery...really any time of the day... expect a call telling you they either \\\"don't have bread\\\" or they'll tell you they don't have a delivery driver. Freaky fast delivery? More like freakishly unpredictable and incredibly unreliable/nonexistent delivery. Absolutely obnoxious. Food is always fresh and good, however the service is terrible.  They never get the order right and the employees are rude and not helpful.  The GM is terrible.  AVOID Terrible customer service including the manager. Had a driver yell for not getting a tip, do better the food is still great I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but this jimmy johns not only got our order wrong twice when we were in the store, we realized after we had left that they had forgotten to put meat on two of the sandwiches. The sandwich also left my stomach very unsettled making me think I got a touch of food poisoning too. This jimmy johns needs some serious improvement. I've been here several times, and every time the service has not met Jimmy Johns status. My last visit is what pushed me to write this review and to not return.\\n\\n1. The lady making my sandwich was bossy and yelling at her kids while she was making my sandwich.\\n\\n2. They locked all the doors when they closed in an hour and a half. When I was unlocking the door to leave, the same lady demandingly yelled and told me not to unlock the door. How do you except me to leave? I ignored her and opened it anyway.\\n\\n3. Same lady lied to me. When she handed me my sandwich she said the bread was hard because it just came out of the oven. But it wasn't hot. I'm a professional baker, bread is hard because you burned it or its stale. I wasn't going to complain but don't lie to me. The bread wasn't enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n4. They are slow compared to most Jimmy Johns.\\n\\n\\nDon't yell at me don't lie to me and send your kids home. I'm used to getting fast, friendly service at Jimmy John's. This place was neither of those things. I was the only customer there, so it's not like they were too busy. The lady who was making my sandwich started to make it, and then stopped so she could finish her conversation with I coworker. The sandwich wasn't put together very well. I don't expect to visit this location again. Just like the commercials say, this place is FAST.  By the time I paid and finished putting my change in my wallet they were handing me a sandwich.  I thought they were accidentally handing me someone else's... LOL\\nOn my most recent visit, I ordered The Vito.  It was noticeably fresh with decent flavor, but it could have used a little more meat and liquid (oil, vinegar, mustard, mayo). \\nIf you are pressed for time though as I was on this day, this is your perfect lunch spot. First off customer service definitely lacked. Walking in it looked like they were closed. Crew members were sitting and leaning on tables and loud music was playing. The girl that took my order was slightly rude (making a comment to a sauce I wanted on my sandwich). When wrapping up my order, the same girl that took my order reaches into the pickle jar and takes a pickle with her BARE HANDS. Ew never will I ever come back to this establishment. No one wants to spend money at a place where the employees clearly don't care. This use to be my favorite Jimmy Johns location but the quality of workers has really brought the service down.  My last visit during my transaction the cashier (named Marie ) never spoke or looked at  me once..  I'm not kidding.  I walked in she stood next the register so i started giving my order, she put her hand out for my credit card and gave me a receipt.  I have to find a new favorite location. Walked in the other day. Ordered a sandwich to go. The gentlemen who helped me were very nice and accommodating. It was my first time ever being at a JJ's and they were patient and answered all my questions Sandwich was made fresh. Since I wasn't eating the sandwich right away, I was worried about it getting soggy. Not the case. I ate half and ended saving the other half for even later and it was still fresh! Even though I didn't eat it there, still a clean establishment. I called for a delivery order at 4 pm.  The lady taking my order was more interested in talking to someone else about going on breaks.  She was VERY RUDE to me (as a paying customer) and acting like I was interrupting her.  WTF Jimmy Johns.  I know you are better than this. \\n\\nSOO.... 30 minutes later (when my order should have been delivered) the same rude woman calls me back to let me know their delivery driver will not be in for work until 5 pm.  WHY WASN'T I TOLD THIS WHEN I ORDERED????  She offers no apology or any explanation.  She advises me that I can wait until their driver shows up for work OR I can come pick it up myself.  I cancelled the order. This location will not have my business any longer. \\n\\nThis Jimmy John's is terrible and DOES NOT live up to their company standards.  It's pathetic. Customer service at this location is the worst i have ever expirienced.  \\n\\nI called in an order. I may have as well gone through  a drive through.  You know what happens there.  You get F#@#@ed. \\n\\n I   asked if my special request had been fulfilled and was told  yes.  Upon return to work i found that the request was honored but my order was worng.  \\n\\nWhen i called to complain is when the horrible service began.  That store is run by incompetent extremely rude people.\\nI was  told that there  was no way to speak with the owner of this franchise location.  No response from a call i have in to him either.   I guess the poor service is from top to bottom.   Will never go there again. I didn't get his name, but the guy with dreads fixed my sandwich. His sandwich counter was filthy and he didn't follow any directions on light mayo, light mustard etc. Super fast but that because they barely made the sandwich. Turkey sandwich what could go wrong... let me tell you. \\nI had to search for the lettuce due to such a small amount even a friend asked if I ordered no lettuce. There was more mayo than turkey, I guess 1 slice of turkey is the spec because the whole office enjoyed their bread and mayo experience.  But it was fast.  Increase your quality and not just speed. I called in my order and when I got there girl was cleaning down and never made my food. Took off cleaning glove picked up new glove and made my tuna sandwich. But she was stoned and store smelled like trees, they had the door open. I walked into pot lounge. Never going back Horrible customer service and unprofessional delivery driver. Why would you call a customer to complain about an accidental tip online. You never know what someone has waiting on you IN CASH! Oh and they hang up on you too. Never give this location business. Hopefully they all lose their jobs in the next few months. I think Jimmy John's has a pretty good product. The meat is pretty fresh, as well as the lettuce. Their bread is pretty tasty too. You can expect to pay $7 and change for a sandwich or $11 and change for a combo. If their prices were a tad bit cheaper I'd say it's worth five stars. All in all it's a convenient, healthy option for lunch! Worst seen to date!! Ordered online and the app showed that it was made and out for delivery within 20 min... well, after an hour I called and they said they had to bake the bread and it was cooling and that they would make it in about 10 min. It was finally delivered 1 hr and 40 min after it was ordered. Almost TWO hours for a sandwich!!! WOW... This is the absolute worst Jimmy John's I've ever been to.  They are very slow, customer service is terrible, they can't make a sandwich like you ordered if their life depended on it.  They argue with you if you call them out on their error and insist you are wrong...  Um.... I'm the customer, remember?  I used to go here every week, but I don't think I'll be back unless there's a real turnover in employees.  It's a real shame too. Went to Jimmy Johns after work because nothing else was open for vegans around that area. This was around 9:20p. I got the veggie club. They started making the sandwich and said they were out of tomato. I said \\\"you don't have any at all?\\\". She was like yea but they're in the back and I would have to cut it. (With a attitude) She then looked at the time like I was wasted her time to close and clean up. This staff has always been over it and looked like they don't want to work there. Not surprising really. Giving two stars because she actually cut the tomato for me, attitude and all.\",\n          \"Food was adequate for what it was. My boyfriend ordered a Mojito, they had no mint, said nothing and instead ended up with what tasted like crystal light, vodka and too much lime juice....not terribly interested in returning. This is a dive that I used to go to, but do not anymore because of a proximity factor. As I said it is just a dive to meet and chat, have a drink with friends, and so expectations not being to high, it never really disappoints. Service is kind of lacking sometimes. I was happy with the Nachos. Wish there was more cheese on it. But the guacamole was top notch!\\n\\nHeads UP: They have a 50 cent charge for take out. Cheap drinks, lots of room, realy friendly bar tender, cheap pool, and lots of fun alcoholics. so cute. really close to the max and a great haven to escape from the crazies on skidmore. WTF.... Had to pay for food before even ordered ...Hmmm ever been to burger king if so EAT ThERE service is better and the food with out  a thought 10000 times better.\\nAs for service stay away from the bartender Joe just a wipe we brought my partner's parents here and had the veggie s/m burger with salad. my partner had the eggs benedict, and they shared the french dip with fries. everything was delicious, and the server was so friendly and efficient. love the atmosphere. Went in for lunch during the week and sat in a booth far away from the bar.  I think all the action was at the bar because we never got any service.  When we first sat down someone asked us what we would like and we said we needed a minute. Then no one ever came back.  After a while we just got up and left and ate some place near by because being ignored made us feel awkward and I didn't want to go ask for service and seem rude.  I'm just too passive to eat here. This is my fav lunch and dinner spot. The service is too notch and the food is excellent. There is a new owner who is committed to the bar and her employees. I really appreciate her commitment as a regular. They have switched up the menu and introduced craft cocktails! I recommend coming down to this spot for lunch, dinner or happy hour. I hear the brunch is spot on also I am excited for Pride! The place will be packed! I had no idea this bar was over here. In this side of town you just get used to your usual places unless you live downtown, work there or spend way too much time in bars...no offense...everyone needs hobbies right. I love the decor which seemed pretty butch and no dive bar at all - I was confused as to the reviews mentioning it as a dive since that was not the impression I got at all though I hear they went through a remodel. The staff were amazing and when we went there with a Barfly bus filled with 40 they slammed our drink orders out smoking fast. The drinks were well priced and well made too. Nothing screamed gay bar at all and there was a birthday party happening with catering and everything which was neat - that they can section off parts like that. My boyfriend and I frequent this bar, but not just for the drinks.  We are both big fans of the food.  Attention is paid to the quality of the meals you get and the prices are reasonably low for the the amount they serve you.  The service tends to be kind of spotty, a bit of a hit or miss sort of thing, but there are a few waiters/bartenders that make it all the more worth it to stop in.  It is conveniently located just off the max line and is very easy to find if you know what you are looking for, though we found that we had actually walked by the place several times without even being aware of it's existence.  It is relatively conservative inside on the decor, and not nearly as in-your-face as something like The Eagle, but you still sense a presence of acceptance and tolerance.  It is not uncommon to see men dressed as women at the bar ordering a drink and talking to the bartenders as old friends.  It's a welcoming environment.\\nMy only suggestion for the place would be to hire on a new waiter or two.  There have been several times my boyfriend and I have gone in and had to wait an unusually long time to have our orders taken, or to get our check.  We don't mind too much, especially considering there is typically 1-2 people working as bartenders and doubling as waiters.  It isn't there fault, I just hope that management notices that many of their customers aren't as tolerant to their short-staffed nature as my boyfriend and I are.  \\nAll in all, this place is a good time with great food.  Check it out when you're not in a hurry and ask about the specials-some of them are REALLY great deals.  Cheers! Absolutely HORRIBLE service!!!! Refused to give us water unless we bought alcohol first! Completely outrageous behavior from the bartender, will never go there again. Have never been treated so horribly I've been to Fox & Hounds a handful of times now, and each time it's the same bartender. That's comforting. It's a nice, \\\"old man bar\\\" - but, there aren't a lot of old men here, generally speaking. For a nice, quiet gay bar, I highly suggest this place. If C.C. Slaughters is too loud for you to talk, pop on in to Fox & Hounds and have a few drinks. \\n\\nThey have a pretty extensive menu, as well - including your old standby's of fried bar food. The French Dip is simple but quite good. The Jalapeno Poppers are a favorite. The Chicken Strips and Fries are quite sufficient and tasty. \\n\\nOne pool table, lots of seating, friendly establishment. The location to the dance club of Slaughters night life is perfect. I'd definitely try stopping in and not let previous reviews strip you of the opportunity to support this local establishment. A couple weeks ago, my friend and I went to Fox & Hounds for the Ladies of Rock drag show fundraiser for various charities. We got there super early and the servers were very attentive. My friend and I had just eaten dinner somewhere else and weren't really looking to order anything food/ drink wise, so we tried to stay under the radar with the ordering. Eventually the place filled up and we didn't have to keep saying we were waiting for friends to order. Anyway, I would definitely come here again for another drag show. I'm glad I didn't drink because the unisex bathrooms were kind of gross (why can't boys pee IN the toilet?) and I didn't want to have to go again. That's my only real criticism... I would not waste your time or money at The Fox & Hounds.  I went there with a friend the other night to grab some food and a beer.  The restaurant from the street looked inviting and the atmosphere pleasant.  We sat ourselves, per instruction from the sign in the entrance, and waited for our server.  We waited and waited and waited.  20 minutes later our server, real short hair and balding, pale in complection and rocking 2 tattooed arm sleeves, came over to us and apologized for the wait saying he didn't see us.  I wasn't sure how that could be as we were sitting in direct line of sight.  No problem, I'll take his word for it and let it go.  We got our menus and ordered beers right away.  20 minute wait made us thirsty.  Our server proceeded to take a beverage order for a table of 8 next to us.  Then he shot back up to the bar and began doing I don't know what.  At one point he removed his shirt to expose his white tank-top undershirt.  A little classless but whatever- I'm not judging.  10 minutes later the server came over with drinks in his hands for the table of 8.  That was the last straw for me and we got up and left.  Upon exiting the server asked us \\\"oh, are you guys leaving?\\\" Either he had no clue of his poor customer service on display or he just didn't really want to serve us.  Whatever way you look at it, it was poor poor service.  I wish I could comment on the food but we didn't get that far.  Portland has many, many food options and The F&H is not worth your time! It's not a busy Saturday afternoon but, a lot of dirty tables. Every ketchup bottle was almost empty it took three to get enough for my fries. Plus the bottles were all dirty. Napkins were non existent. No line at the bar but, I had to wait over five minuets to get a Coke while the bartender chatted with his friend. \\nBartender was super nice & food is improved over the old management but, some serious side work etc needs to be taken into consideration. One bus tub and about five minuets would have had the dining room looking neat. I hit Fox's regularly. It's like \\\"Cheers\\\" for the Portland gay crowd.  Food is reasonable and good, drinks are strong, and the atmosphere is warm, inviting, friendly.  Friday happy hour is great. The ambience is Cheers-esque, which happened to be playing on the tv above the bar when I was there for lunch recently. It's neighborhoody. There are regulars. The bartender learns your name. The service is very good--the bartender who is also the waiter during the day is warm without being over the top. He's sincere, low-key, and consistent.\\nThe food is actually pretty good. Some things shine--like their daily soups. The beer and cheese soup that I had was one of the best beer and cheese soups I've ever had. And their grilled cheese is just like mom used to make. On the surface, it's a three star joint. But something about it keeps inviting me back. So I'll throw it another star for that ineffable 'come back' quality. Been to this restaurant before, food and atmosphere were not anything special. Now, on their menu, they are blaming increased prices on new minimum wage laws. I will not in any way support a restaurant that takes worker protections out on their own employees. I feel bad for those people. Your employer is clearly terrible and you should probably seek new employment. Shame on you, Fox and Hounds. I will never return to your establishment and will encourage my friends, family and colleagues to do the same. If you have a problem with local laws, take it out on your legislators, not on your workers and the community. That was nice bar... Good taste ... Meeting friend and drink and eat .. Kind of relaxing place to go there ... The bartender is surprisingly rude & slow despite there being 9 people here not ordering, just listening to shitty 80's music and being old/bitter. \\n10ish minutes after ordering, they told us they didn't have the ingredients for what we ordered, and were uppity when we asked to see the menu again. They messed up my order, and what I got was an over-priced, dried out travesty. And everyone 45+ and/or bitter lesbian/gay got better service than us (young gays), point of order: came in after us, got food before us. That autistic guy isn't lying! And their fugly regulars decided to chime in when my friend had a \\\"difficult\\\" vegetarian order (#SorryNotSorry it's 2015 and you live in Portland). Not coming back. Good food, inexpensive drinks.  The dinner special on Friday was Prime Rib for $12.50!  How could you pass that up?\\n\\nI rarely had to wait at the bar for service, the bartender was friendly. Until last night, I had only been to Fox and Hounds once with a friend for a quick stroll through and once during Pride Week when everyone was drunk and acting crazy. \\nLast night, a friend and I went for happy hour and dinner.  This area of town seems to be really calm and slow until later at night, which is cool, if you just want a relaxed time.  There were maybe two other people when we arrived around 4:30 and then maybe four tables of people when we left.  \\nThe drinks were good and strong.  I had  crispy chicken salad, which was really good.  The chicken wasn't heavily battered and the salad had lots of different veggies.  I forgot to ask for no cheese as I'm trying to avoid dairy and they don't put any on it anyway, so I was happy.  My friend's club sandwich looked really good and he said it was. Prices were very reasonable. \\nThe bartender was low key, not super friendly but mellow.  I'd definitely recommend Fox and Hounds if you just want a mellow drink or meal, I've no idea what the later crowd is like. Well, the decor was beautiful, the food fantastic.  The bar staff was about as friendly and courteous as a plague infected rat.  Go there for the ambiance and the food, but don't except the welcoming committee...it doesn't exist there Small kitchen means you might be waiting for 4 tacos for 50 minutes on a Tuesday... that's with the bar at half capacity. I know there is a new owner and I think she would be best served by simplifying the menu. It is better to do a few things really well, than to do a lot of things slightly better than poorly. It's the only bar open for lunch in the area, they have a real opportunity to be a draw. I'll keep my fingers crossed. Worst experience ever. Just got into town & was looking for a quick meal & drink before a show downtown. This place liked decent and had customers inside, so I entered...I was gonna wet myself as I was finishing my coffee I'd been drinking during the trip so I immediately went into the restroom before making my way toward the bar (a sign in the entryway said \\\"Please seat yourself\\\" and there was no greeter). As I did a gentleman approached & said \\\"Hey man when you came in here you broke about 3 of my rules. You didn't talk to any of us, you had a backpack on, and you have a drink in your hand. Now get your ass out the door now!\\\" I tried explaining that I'd never been there so didn't know about \\\"his rules\\\", nor did I think I had to speak to anyone since the sign said seat yourself. However, anytime I tried to speak he just yelled \\\"Out the door\\\" over & over, louder & louder. Needless to say, I won't be coming here again & neither should you! Rude gay bar. I am straight and don't mind patronizing any business.  They have a beautiful bar and nice happy hour. The bartender, however, made me feel unwelcome. He was talking to other gay customers about an orgy he attended the night before. I really didn't care but decided to leave for a quieter place. After tipping him I turned to leave and he called me breeder.\\n\\nThe food menu is good. Yes, strong drinks, but do I have to deal with a rude waiter? This place should not discriminate against anyone, but I guess my Aspergers is not accepted here. I asked a couple simple questions and received rude responses and then I was targeted to receive my food last and only after I asked where my food was. Then I didn't get my bill when I asked. I won't be back if he is around. Fox and the Hounds has the honor of being my first 1 star review . If you haven't been through the gauntlet to be a regular, or aren't a rude mouthy lesbian, over the age of 40, or a desperate gay alcoholic, no reason to come here, unless you're craving bowling ally food, without the bowling ally. \\nDefinitely NOT a place everyone in the gay community can feel welcome, as a gay 20 something, I was absolutely appalled by the customer service. \\nI'm a hairstylist, so patron interactions are the single most important thing for me when it comes to my dining experience, and this was the worst I've ever had. I killed him with kindness to find the bartender had a headache, and was stressed from calling the cops on a drunk/over served 90 y/o regular.\\n I would give the place 2 stars because he wasn't feeling so great, but I have never been treated so horribly! And then another regular, a large butch women mocked me for my \\\"complicated\\\" order ( a veggie burger with no cheese or mayonnaise) I knew she was a regular because she asked about the bartenders recent vacation. \\nIt's almost laughable! How is this place still in business?! I live on the NW park blocks, and have been looking for a relaxed place to come to that wasn't the atmosphere of C.C's. Unfortunately, the search continues, and I'll make sure to let my friends and clients know where to NOT go for a good time. Wow! What has happened to Fox and Hound? I just went there for dinner, and it was horrible. First the blonde bimbo bartender was too busy talking to the three people that were at the bar but finally I ordered a drink. Told her I'd be at the table and I want to dinner. Literally the cook had to tell her that I was ready to order. I waited and waited for my salad which I asked for no onions. Finally the cook brought out my dinner and I had to tell him what about my salad. I got my salad covered in onions after my dinner was brought out. Got the chicken fried steak dinner it was so salty I could not even finish it. Then I had to go up to the bar to get my bill because she never came back over to the table. And she actually asked me \\\"oh did you have to drinks?\\\" Fox and Hound a hard no. Is this place even a gay establishment anymore? Apparently there is a new owner. She needs to work on customer service and the menu and hiring the right people. I give Fox & Hounds 4 out of 5 stars mainly because of the staff, who are very friendly and accepting of everyone. They make newcomers feel like regulars. \\n\\nIt is primarily a gay bar, but you could bring business clients there for lunch and never know it was a gay bar. Tasteful, conservative decor. Lots of straight people enjoy it as well. A good place to bring mixed sexuality groups, without making anyone feel uncomfortable. \\n\\nIf rated for their food, the score would be one star lower, I'm afraid. They rely too much on frozen, fried food. That having been said, though, their food is better than most bar food, and sometimes they really hit a home style daily special out of the park. And, their hamburgers are very reliable. Not quite gourmet burgers, but better than your average bar fare.\\n\\nThey have a Sunday brunch that is quite good if you arrive early and the food is still fresh. A friend and I stopped at this place today, Sat, Apr 26, '14, at about 3 pm.\\n\\nFood was ok, not great.  Drinks were a bit weak.\\n\\nBut the bartender (slender, about 48-49, short hair) was RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!!  No wonder there were only 3 other people there. came in here to escape the rain. drinks were strong and the bartender was great - good service and friendly. my boyfriend most definitely attracts the gay male population in portland as he got chatted up on the street numerous times, it's almost like we were attracted to this bar by divine intervention ;) I literally couldn't believe it..... Saturday of Portland Pride weekend, the place was packed, and the management had allotted ONE front of the house employee- the bartender!! \\n\\nI will never go back, because of their extremely poor showing on Pride. A gay bar? There's plenty better queer dives in this town. Horrible SERVICE! & Rude.... not personable at all... was frowned at and glared at while ordered food & i brought family in to eat and have a cocktail.. Gurllll.. shameful.. I am very very disappointed in this place! It's in a great location near CC Slaughters so you would think this place would have more business. This place could be great. Sadly the service suck! Specially the old bitch cranky bartender!  What is up with his diva attitude! He's chasing away customers and thanks to him business is going down for them! I would hope the owner would realize this place could be great with out crappy service! Just remember have a bad experience ill tell 10 people, have a great experience I will come back and bring people in! Your move! So my friend and I needed to use a bathroom bad! We popped in here and she went in while I waited my turn, the bartender came over and said \\\"we have 2 more bathrooms in back. He was so friendly we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink. I don't mind that the place was mostly a gay bar, even though we were obviously not. He was really nice and welcoming. I will definitely recommend The Fox and Hounds. Cute place and super chill. love it.  It's your total comfort food place if you ever need one.  It's a great queer place to hang out at as well.  Drinks are made strong, which is good!\\n\\nThe staff was great and the prices were pretty reasonable for the amount of food that you get!  Plus they are open super super late! A very low-key gay bar. Perfect environment for the gay community, but without the extremes. Good food, fair prices. I work right across the street from Fox & Hounds.  During the summer months when I go outside to eat my lunch I always see people from the company I work for go and eat at this establishment.  I often wondered why so many people went over there.  Is it a convenience factor?  Is the food really that good?  What gives?  Well, after all these years of working in this neighborhood I decided it was time to see what the deal was.  I took a colleague of mine out for lunch here and another gem was found.\\n\\nFirst off the food here is very affordable.  Most of their sandwiches are under $8.  This is not an $8 sandwich that you get at some of the sandwich shops in town that come with nothing and you laugh at how small it is.  This is a good sized sandwich that comes with a side (salad, fries, cup of soup?).  My colleague had heard that the Chicken Cordon Bleu ($7.25) sandwich was really good here.  That is what we both ended up ordering.  That and a few drinks (of the non-alcoholic variety as it was a work day) got me out the door for only $21.\\n\\nThe sandwich was very tasty.  The chicken was nice and moist and the bun that came along for the ride lasted throughout that ride.  I wanted to be a good boy and get a salad and was quite happy that it was pretty big.  Very good bang for your buck.\\n\\nFox & Hounds is also a bar that I believe caters mostly to the gay crowd.  Not that you have to be gay to come here.  I imagine it gets pretty lively here at nights and on weekends.  I know it as a place to get a sandwich or a burger that won't break the bank.  Now I know and knowing is half the battle. At first I thought this place looked like a spin off a rustic saloon, but then I realized it was just old and dirty. I've been here a couple times and (I hate to say it) ordered the same thing. Each time it looked completely different. Zero consistency. The bartenders are nice, but they go out for smoke breaks often and one of them had a \\\"shift drink\\\" (or shot, more like) during his shift. I see the potential, but definitely needs work. Good atmosphere and good priced drinks. Solid cheeseburger and french dip. My wife and I didn't even realize it was a gay bar until halfway through our meal. I'd go back for another french dip. It was late on a Friday night.  We were looking for a quiet place for an after-the-show get-together.  One of our friends highly recommended Fox & Hounds, stating something about the bartender always excited to them, so we took the small stroll over.\\nFrom the outside, it looked like the ambiance we were looking for.  Relaxed, pool tables in the corner for casual games, and a bat half filled with patrons.  The transition inside was not what I was expecting, which was the loud music which made things really difficult for me.  Everyone else seemed to be able to communicate just fine over the blaringly obviously iTunes playlist on shuffle that played on the speaker system; for me though, I just gave up taking part of any conversation and just wish the night would end and go home. Used to like this place. New owners, new name. The rainbow flag is gone. Using the restroom requires asking for a key attached to a ridiculously large tchatchke. The tchatchke was disgustingly filthy. Like using the restroom at a Texaco. I ordered the fish and chips. The menu said ling cod. I got frozen Atlantic cod. Major difference. The coleslaw was old enough to vote, it was rotten and translucent. My husband got the Cordon Bleu. He still smells like onions. ONIONS! The fries were ok, large steak fries but the ketchup was obviously married and I didn't want to play shigellosis roulette. A sports themed bar with shitty food is really the last thing Old town/Chinatown needs at this point. Especially one that ignores the neighborhood demographics. Good luck Second Ave Sports Bar, you're gonna need it. Giving this place 5 stars because there is a new owner that is working hard to make things better. It is worth coming down again to check out since I think most people have forgotten about this place. Menu has been slimmed down to a more manageable selection. Food service at this time is still a little slow to get out orders. This is a bit of a problem during the weekday lunch hour since most people downtown are on a schedule and need to get in and out and back to work.  I think after a few of the kinks and growing pains are worked out this will be a downtown hangout worth coming back to. Came in yesterday for a quick drink before catching the train to the airport. Quiet, local gay bar. I encountered a nice bartender who pointed me in the right direction to the train stop, so I'm kind of surprised by the negative Yelp reviews as I didn't experience anything remotely like what I've read. Very fun, good food, casual, just up the street from more touristy places. Friendly crowd and staff. Beautifully remodeled, nice and dimly lit with a warm and cozy atmosphere complemented with friendly and attitudeless service.   I find this place great for relaxing with a beer and a shot after work.  Far cry from yesteryear when the establishment was frequented by loud over weight, unattractive, tweakers/drunks with personalities equal to that of underwatered houseplants.  Good moderately priced menu.  I would frequent this place more often if the pool table was less than seventy-five cents per game......or even  free!! Ate here before and enjoyed it, returned recently and I gotta say putting a sticker on your menu saying \\\"due to mimimum wage increases everything on the menu is +$1\\\" is also saying \\\"I'd literally pay my workers less than this if the government would let me\\\" or \\\"I don't care about my employees, so they won't care about the quality of your food.\\\" \\nNever coming back and advising other to not eat here! This is a quiet, relaxing place.  I like that!  If you're looking for loud music and a raucous atmosphere, this isn't the place for you.  But it's a very pleasant place with reasonable prices on food and drink.  Just one word of advice..  if you order steak or prime rib, ask for it to be cooked rare.  They seem to overcook the beef here until it's dry and tasteless. I have had really bad experience here.. But I am updating my review based on my experience with a bartender named Matt... Really awsome... Visit the ba when he is around! This is a nice place to grab a sandwich and a draft beer. Gay friendly, but not all gay. We went on a monday (yesterday eve). It was Labor Day, not crowded at about 5:30pm. My first time there. I got the rueben sandwich and a salad (instead of fries). Salad was crisp and fresh, rueben was good but note that there is very little meat in the sandwich but it was still ok. It was $8 or $7.something.  A friend got the mac and cheese with bacon. A lot of food and very good, but a tad pricey at $9. The 3rd in our group got the Monday special: a small steak, baked potato, brocolli, and side salad all for $9,50. Very good deal. The service was VERY slow. The bartender was also the server. He was busy talking with the two guys sitting at the bar or going outside to smoke to give us any decent service. But who is in a rush? Glad we weren't. So don't get the rueben til they start putting more meat but the other meals, the atmosphere, all worth it. h and maybe don't go on mondays...get a different server that way. we had a rough week, and had been meaning to come here for some time. we came for lunch 12-22-12. began with a bloody mary, and a corona. next, i chose the veggie s. and m. burger on wheat with a salad and oil/vinegar. my partner had the traditional s. and m. burger with fries. the drinks hit the spot, and the food was delicious. our server/bartender was the best...he was so efficient, funny, friendly, and very customer-focused...we will be back...thx so much... Atmosphere here is great, there is a pool table for those that are interested.  My server was very friendly and funny. My only complaint (which is kinda silly), is the well vodka is foul.  I'm not a picky drinker and order well often, but I ordered a drink and a friend did also, both of us could barely choke it down.  Neither were made incorrectly... they were definitely what we ordered, but the vodka was a little odd... almost bitter.  I can't really fault the establishment though, because you can simply choose another brand of vodka; I would recommend they look into switching that out though and again, I'm really not picky with that stuff.  We will definitely be back! I have gone a couple of time in the past year to Fox & Hounds (little bar/food joint) because it is conveniently located near my job.  It's a dive but I continue to go.  Everytime I go the service is late.  This last time I went is the LAST time I will ever go!!!  Let me break it down for you...\\n\\nI walk in and the waiter (they only have one) looks me directly in the face as I walk myself to a booth.  He continues to take care of the table he is serving at the time.  He walks around the bar and walks behind the bar and gets their drinks ready.  He continues to go back to their table with their drinks and will not look at me...keep in mind I'm right behind him.  He walks back to give the cook their orders and then walks behind the bar to chitchat w/the barflies.  I'm staring him down the WHOLE time.  He then goes and gets their food from the cook area.  At that time I go and get my own menu!  I walk back to my booth and he's right behind me!!!  He serves that last table with their food and goes back behind the bar to chitchat.  Finally...20 minutes later he comes over as if nothing is wrong.  He has stupid smile on his face like he knows he should apologize!!!  But he doesn't!  By this time my date (fiance) had shown up and we order.  By the time we are get our food we eat a couple of bites and have to box it up and leave!  Never once did he apologize or anything.  I have, like I said, been to this place a couple of times and every time I feel like I don't get the service that I deserve!!! Cheap good food.  Besides just being across the street from work, the best part about going there is Jeff, the bartender.  LOVE him.  I've only been there for lunch during work, so I haven't tried any drinks, but the food is good for bar food. DO NOT GO HERE\\n\\n(To the owner, feel free to get in contact with us)\\n\\nseriously we used to be regulars and have gone to this bar for over a DECADE!\\n\\nThis is the last time we will ever go to this bar. \\nYou had many chances and disappointed our group every Sunday for the last couple months.\\n\\nIt's Sunday and we called around 2pm, told them a large group of us will be showing up again. (usually ends up being around 10-15 people, plus others who join us and some who leave during our regular meet-ups) They told us they would be open their POSTED HOURS.\\n\\n(That means you were supposed to be open until 11 every Sunday night)\\n\\n we got there and the lights were off and doors locked, it's now only 6:50pm.\\n\\nThe last time we all tried to meet here, (we meet every Sunday here around 7pm) they told us they were no longer serving food for the day because the grill kept catching fire. (Ok I guess)\\n\\nBut then we ordered fried food and eventually (after three orders of only being able to choose from french fries or tater tots, are you kidding me!?) they told us they were no longer doing fried food either!\\n\\nI'm more then sure at this point, as is the rest of the group, they just didn't want to make food.\\n\\nThey closed an hour and half EARLY last Sunday\\nAn hour early the Sunday prior. \\nAnd many times before that.\\n\\nI work in the service industry, I UNDERSTAND wanting to go home, however I suck it up since I chose the field and job. I work 50/60+ hours a week so I really really understand that. But as a manager who covers shifts and volunteers to close, no matter how slow it might get, I ALWAYS stay open. ALWAYS have everything stocked and KNOW my inventory!\\n\\nIF ITS ON THE MENU,  YOU SERVE IT. PERIOD.\\n\\nDONT LET YOUR KITCHEN STAFF COME UP TO THE FRONT OF THE BAR COMPLAINING THAT SOMEONE GOT THEM SWISHER SWEETS INSTEAD OF SOME OTHER CIGARETTES WHILE CURSING LOUDY IN FRONT OF YOUR GUESTS.\\n\\nHOLY MOLY LADY! GOSH HECKIE YOUR STAFF IS A JOKE. \\n\\nFrom one business owner to another. The biggest regret I had when I bought my restaurant was not letting go of staff members who kept dragging it down and had repeated customer service issues. (Everyone gets a second chance) Eventually I let them go and I actually saw a lot of my regulars returning to me. \\n\\nYou should probably let some people go and start covering shifts yourself. Who knows, you might get customers back. \\n\\nI hope other customers step up and complain so you know what the in the world is going on at your bar.\\n\\nGet your staff and your service back in order.\\n\\nYou have lost a large group of customers and although we will be open to talking about a bunch of issues, we will not be returning to this bar again. That's a minimum of 10+ people your staff has alienated. I always knew Fox & Hounds to be a gay dive bar on the level that the Dirty Duck was, so I never really gave it a chance.  Recently a colleague of mine said she loved to go there after work, which I found odd given how I just described the place.  But yesterday I found myself there for some pool and cheap drinks (Hot Toddies for $5.50) and a friendly crowd.   \\n\\nTo me it still seems apparently gay, but I guess I'm a little more in tune with the cues.  My straight colleagues still enjoy themselves, as it should be.  It doesn't feel divey or dirty at all, probably due to their recent remodel.  I know I'll be back here for drinks with co-workers and some good games of pool. F&H is an unassuming sexless gay bar, where they pour cheap, strong drinks, the regulars are hardcore drinkers and the decor and  lighting are atrocious (akin to a Shari's). Fried food, bad music,  tube TV's and video poker add to the ambiance. \\n\\nIn sum, it's too brightly lit,  the vibe is lackluster, the dicks are limp but the drinks ARE stiff.\\n\\nL'Chaim! I'm feeling nice so giving them three stars because things turned around in the last year for me here. I've often wondered what I need to do in order to get half decent service here. It's taken me nearly five years and they treat me better, but still, worse than Denny's.\\n\\nThanks for having such a big menu, there are some edible things on it, which is more than most gay places in this town. I've got stories though... Moldy fried food, and a taco with a raw corn tortilla? Imagine trying to eat that?\\n\\nI go there because my friends who have been around longer go there and they have more money, flirt with the staff and tip them big. I guess that's how it's done... Echoing what the previous reviewers said...total dive bar.  However,  I had a really great experience there and plan on going back when I come back to Portland.  The staff were all friendly and attentive, my drink did not stay empty long without one of the servers asking if I needed another (yes please!).  The drinks themeselves were strong and cheap (ahhh the way I like em!), the food was decent considering the dive-y-ness of the place, the music was fun and the patrons were also friendly and a lot of fun.  There were four of us in our party, and we escaped with plenty of drinks and nibbles for under $60.00, which was worth an additional star. I have been going to the Fox and Hound for over 20 years and always had a good time and ran into lots of friend.  WHAT HAPPENED!!!  Does not feel like a gay bar anymore and Friday nights are dead!  What happened to our friendly bartender- Joe.  Always had great service and a good time.  The last 2 Fridays were horrible!!!! Don't know if I will go back! I have been to the Fox and Hounds a few times and have never been disappointed. I am not a \\\"sit at the bar type a guy\\\" so all my experience comes from sitting at the normal tables. The food, drinks, and service has always been extremely good. As with any place, challenges do arise. However, the one time that it did, the staff was extremely apologetic and took care of the problem right away. As with all the other reviews, the place is beautiful and very inviting to all. Thank you, Fox and Hounds. I will definitely keep coming back. I went here to meet someone for brunch.  To my surprise it was pretty nice.  I had an omelet and coffee for $8.which is a really low price for what you get.\\n\\nThe waiter was a bit absent minded, but it kind of gave the place character.  \\n\\nThe place is a staple low cost place to eat for the local gay community.\\n\\nThis is located just one block from the Chinatown/downtown stop on the Red or Blue MAX light rail trains. Always a favorite place for a good, solid, simple weekend breakfast without the Portland brunch wait. Excellent service. Generous cocktails. Affordable. And, yes, it's a gay bar but we straights are made perfectly welcome. Super nice people. And yes, you may have to maneuver around a couple of street people, but that's Old Town Portland. All good! When I say we get around.. we get around.. ;) Stopped in here Friday night after we couldn't get into the other place we planned so we had to pass the place we were supposed to go and ended up in this place. Had a few drinks in here, the atmophere was nice and friendly. Had a great time just kicking back and having a few. While I would have liked to go dancing.. thats ok.. I can be just as at home in a place like this if not more. \\n\\nI love pursuing downtown when you don't have a car to worry about.. you just from place to place and then you figure out where to catch the max and go home! So much easier and you frequent lots of bars that way too. Just walk from one to the next.. no problem! Would go in here again. They really do look after thier customers! Fox & Hounds is one of those places that's set off from the main path and once you find it, you're glad it is. The atmosphere is pleasant even when it's filled with regulars. It's a great place to grab a beer or a bite and read a book or just be alone with your thoughts but it's also a great place to gather with friends. \\n\\nService is prompt and efficient and provided by a warm, friendly staff. I've never felt rushed here even when they're visibly busy. You're given the feeling that you are your servers' or bartenders' only customer and these days, that kind of service is a rare find. \\n\\nThe menu is descriptive and offers better than the average bar fare. Try the Mac n Cheese with bacon...creamy goodness served with your choice of soup or salad. Generous portions so anticipate taking half your meal home with you. \\n\\nDrinks are cheap and strong. I know what you're thinking, nuff said! This place sucks. I asked for shots for my friends and was told that the bartender didn't \\\"feel like making shots\\\" so we were only allowed beers. What kind of bar does that? He also told us that if we ended up at his bar, we were probably kicked out of a club nearby. Not true at all for our crew, but I guess that's the type of crowd this bar attracts...\\n\\nNo wonder this bar is huge and only has two people other than us on a Friday night. After my second offensive attempt to have a drink at CC's (see my review), I discovered this gem of a bar.  I can't recommend it enough.\\n\\nNice decor, super bartender's, hot looking AND friendly customers, and an above par drink.\\n\\nWhat more can you ask for? Havent been here in awhile. Found out its under new management. Prices are still low drinks are still good. New menu. New pool tables.Gotta love this place. Like with any gay bar in Portland, don't expect attentiveness on your first few visits - unless you are really cute. Bartenders are efficient, not unfriendly and pour a good drink. The beer taps are probably pretty average for Portland and likely will provide something palatable for discerning beer drinkers. \\n\\nIf you hang around the bar a bit you'll notice that the bartenders and some of the regular customers can get rather catty at times - particularly when the odd unknowing group of apparently straight people walk in the door. This can be off-putting or enjoyable depending on your tastes. However, it all seems pretty harmless and just in fun.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty comprehensive and VERY inexpensive. I have tried a few items on the menu and been impressed with the quality. The cook is really very good.  \\n\\nThe place is comfortable, there are several TVs. Don't expect to catch the latest sporting event though. Fine by me. \\n\\nIt really is a nice place to check out particularly with a group of friends. Grab a table if you are seeking a semi-private conversation. Sit at the bar if you enjoy eaves-dropping on (or participating in) the cattiness. Fox & Hounds has been a starting place, mid-party rehydration station, and last stop to some of my best evenings in Portland.  The place is dark and divy, but the staff are always friendly and cheerful.  They make a STRONG long island which is a necessity on any night out in Portland.  It is within walking distance to events like Blow Pony and places like CC Slaughters and Whiskey Bar.  In the middle of the night when you and your friends need a mini break from the party, another drink, and a clean bathroom, go to Fox & Hounds.  Pull up a chair, share a drink, and get a little quality chat time in with your friends before rejoining the party. If you want a place to dine that is fabulous in all areas, make your way to Fox And Hounds.  Great food and fabulous people. Wow!!!!! I posted some photos of Rick and Jeff. These guys make a restaurant experience memorable  Thanks Rick for the awesome service Can't believe the service tonight.  Girl behind the bar seemed off possibly on something or had been drinking.  It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to to get a drink or bottle of beer. We usually come in on Saturday nights and the bartender who has worked there for years and should be experienced is slow and more interested in idle chit chat than serving customers! Leaving won't be back! First time here, and my last. Sat at the bar, and was forced to witness the drunken owner verbally abuse and humiliate his staff in front of a a bar full of customers. As a customer service business owner myself, I was shocked to see an owner behave this way. I heard from a regular customer seated next to me that this happens often here, and that they can't keep staff as a result. I'm surprised this place hasn't been busted by the OLCC since the owner is drunk while on the premises. The food was good, though, and the staff did their best, given who they have to work for. This place has solid food and the the new owner is proactive to to say the least. and I know they've been going through a lot of changes. I've worked in the industry long enough to know things get weird and unpredictable. It's a good bar don't bitch about food issues. If you can't afford a nice brunch or steak at real restaurant that doesn't those things don't bitch about the BAR you are sitting in. Have a drink chill out...Jim... maybe have a more understanding humble point of view...coming from a church goer.\",\n          \"Beer menu is limited but decent, food items are fresh and delicious. Ambient is comfy and spacious, prices are OK for the area. Great FL Beer selection. Friendly bar service and nice fresh vegetables to go. I like this place a lot! We have had beer so many times from here. But honestly we get wine and charceuterie from la femme de Fromage. Unfortunately they disappointed us so we sat at Florida and co. Wonderful experience with perky staff (Jennifer) and good alternative food option from houndstooth The food is amazing. The drinks are great craft brews and mimosas. The environment is chill and relaxing! Great place Friendly staff, locally grown and produced products, craft beer and even personal hygiene products... What more can you ask for? Cute bar too! Nice little local hotspot inside East End Market just as you enter. The beautiful natural wood counter invites their customers in to their bar stool seating. The staff are welcoming and knowledgeable on their only local ingredients menu. To be honest, we only came for the drinks menu, but they do serve what looks to be delicious food.\\nMy other half ordered their very affordable beer flight, which included 5 beer samples for just $10! I on the other hand orders their Shrub which is a flavored vinegar with sparking wine or water. Let's just say he got the better end of the deal. Even though their options for beer are limited on draft, the options were tasty. As for me, I should've just stuck with me gut and gotten wine. The Bees Knees with sparkling water was boring. It tasted like just like water at first then a sour honey at the end. I gave it another try with their Mayhaw Berry option, which wasn't any better. To tart for my taste unfortunately.\\nNeedless to say I'm sure we will be back for their beer flight again and just avoid the Shrubs and order their food the next go around. Shout out to Florida & Co for repping the sunshine state HARD! From locally sourced ingredients, to brews from all over our lovely state- this spot is showcasing the flavors of all the fun under the Florida sun.\\n\\nDavid was awesome - and helped to prepare a great Beer Flight for me. From stouts to ciders, I got a chance to try 5 different beers. My two favorites were the Apple Cider from Keel and Curly as well as the Key Lime Beer from Key Billy. \\n\\nI also had a chance to try the Shrimp and Grits my momma ordered. This was as hearty as you'd expect a shrimp and grits to be, but not as decadent as your traditional southern preparation. \\n\\nMade with coconut oil instead of butter, the bowl of grits was topped with hearty portions of shrimp, greens, peppers and onions. It was so flavorful and almost too pretty to eat!\\n\\nThis spot has high top tables and a good amount of bar seating, but they'll also bring your food outside if you decide to dine al fresco.\\n\\nThey've also got a good selection of wines - even some wine on tap! They offer flights of wine as well which is fun. We discovered this little gem while waiting to  get into Domu. We took the server's suggestion, ordered a beer off their featured list and got the small plate Red Snapper Ceviche w/ plaintain chips (idk why it says chips, they were delicious, juicy and thick like normal fried plantains). I thought the ceviche was kind of sharp/acidic but my boyfriend loved it. Definitely recommend the ceviche on top of the plaintain to cancel out some of the acidity (even if it is a bit hard to scoop).\\n\\nCant wait to visit again! : ) A place you can buy local groceries and drink local beer and wine too?! What a unique concept!\\n\\nI haven't drank here yet, but I am very familiar with many of the brews they have on tap and sold as bottles. They are all high quality craft beers, all of which look to be brewed right here in Florida. One side of their grocery counter acts as a bar, where about 5 people can sit and enjoy their beer. You'll also see people sitting outside drinking too.\\n\\nSo far I have only bought a dozen eggs here, picked locally, for $4 a dozen. These are the same eggs you might have seen at the Audubon Park Farmers market. Browsing through their selection, they also have all local arugula, lettuces, heirloom tomatoes, squashes, and frozen meats. Plus spices and bottles of vanilla.\\n\\nI'm looking forward to having a cold local beer here one of these days. Went for the first time two days ago and was extremely impressed!  The pesto meatballs over zucchini \\\"pasta\\\" was fabulous as well as the ceviche, which was equally good.  It was great to be able to drink a grapefruit mimosa with fresh grapefruit pulp in it.  Yummy.  The decor and ambiance was steller!  I highly recommend. Great beer election, very helpful staff. They also have a variety of different products ranging from produce to beard cleanser to vanilla extracts. If you are in Orlando, you absolutely must visit the East End Market and stop by Local Roots. Love east end market overall as a whole but the service at Florida & Co beer was not good at all. We sat,  the guy working took several minutes just to greet us and when he did it wasn't friendly..as if we were a bother. There were only 2 other patrons and he engaged them 100% of the time, non-stop talking  about himself and his plans.  Very disappointing as I'm a local and visit this place often. One should engage, conversation with all customers,  be friendly to all. Thankfully there are other great local shops here with excellent customer service! Florida & Co. is the first place (on the left) when you walk in the front entrance at East End Market.  It used to be called Local Roots, but has been going through a branding change.  My husband and I ordered brunch from  Farm Haus (at the back left of East End) and then sauntered over to the bar at Florida & Co.\\n\\nWe were quickly greeted by two staff members that saw us eyeing their draft menu.  They provided recommendations based on the types of beers we like and my husband and I both ended up with drafts that we enjoyed.  The staff said that we could sit at their counter and eat/drink or we could wander around East End Market with our beers, no need to feel stuck there.  As we were waiting on our food to be ready, we took a seat at the bar there, and remained there eating once we got our food.\\n\\nThe offer locally sourced items such as meat, beer, body products, and honey.  Some of the items seemed a bit pricey to me, but others were what I expected at any market or grocery store.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and chatty with those the customers that were also chatty.  Overall, a great first beer at Florida & Co.  I'm sure we will continue to check out what they have on tap during our visits to the Market. This is an awesome place to find Florida local items. I love shopping small and shopping local, and this place kills two birds with one stone, as it were. They have everything from local craft beers to t-shirts that let you showcase your local love with a great shirt!\\n\\nI'll be headed back to snatch up the honey butter in the cold case. Couldn't take it on my last visit since I wasn't headed home, and it needs to be kept cool.\\n\\nThe staff greeted my sister and I right away and offered help on anything we wanted more info on. I also fell in love with the local roots t-shirt that had the Orlando city skyline on it. \\n\\nOverall: A\\nThis place rocks. I love local stuff and this place has it all! Amazing first experience. Ordered the Southern spicy with Florida white shrimp with a soft egg. Was extremely delicious, I was licking the bowl. Had the right balance of citrus and spice! What can I say it was delicious. Located at the front of the East End Market, Local Roots Farm Store offers a nice selection of items. Greens, veggies, farm fresh eggs, meats and nice locally made pantry items like Mannix Vanilla, grits and home and bath products. \\n\\nThe beautiful wood bar offers up a nice spot to enjoy Quantum Leap wines and Florida brewed craft beers. (Including Cask & Larder) Try a flight and sample your way through some great wines or craft brews. Local Roots offers wifi and a spot to sit down to enjoy your delicious sandwich from Hounds Tooth or maybe La Bretxa. Service is attentive and warm, if you prefer to soak up the beautiful Florida day, it's OK to take your glassware outside to the picnic tables or enjoy the courtyard. I love East End Market and Local Roots is one of the tenant merchants that help cement that love! This is the store that helps make EEM a market. I am able to stop by, pick up some bread, local meat, eggs, and a bottle of something fun!\\n\\nAs previous reviews have mentioned, LR has a fabulous wooden counter that you can sit at while sipping on local wine and beer (sometimes they even have rare brews!). I've also sat there having a coffee from Lineage when EEM was fairly empty and they had no problem with this. \\n\\nThey carry various seasonal greens, local organic meat & poultry, eggs ($4/dozen~ I can dig those prices!), locally-made greeting cards, lotions & elixirs, etc. I always get my eggs here now since they are so cheap and who can beat local, free-range eggs? No one. That's who.\\n\\nBut what always keeps me coming back is the service (isn't it  always that?). The person behind the counter is always incredibly nice and always seems genuinely interested in the customer. Last time I was there I bought some eggs, mentioned that they were for my sister's after-wedding brunch, and the woman gushed to my sister and wished her so much happiness and love. It was so nice and more than just a quick 'congrats.' \\n\\ntl;dr - Great eggs, great service = 5 stars Great selection of local and regional beers on tap and they have a sampler platter my favorite! The good service others rave about was absent during my recent weekend morning visit. A buddy and I sat down to eat food from the bakery across the hall - it was already 82 degrees at 11 a.m. and we didn't want to eat outside. \\n\\nThe Local Roots \\\"bartender\\\" said he only had beer and wine. No cold non-alcoholic drinks. He filled a pitcher with warm tap water (no ice), poured us each a glass and then put the pitcher out of reach. We downed the waters quickly - we'd been out biking - and started at our empty glasses while he spent five minutes counting coins in his coin box.\\n\\nNot wanting to be a pain I waited a while before getting up, walking over, and asking for a refill. He obliged - and then put the warm water pitcher out of reach again before walking off to adjust the twine holding the price tag to the kale basket at the back of the store. Same thing again, staring at empty glasses. There were 0-2 other customers in the store this whole time. \\n\\nI understand that we were not paying customers, but the bartender lost a chance to build goodwill and attract a future customer that would evangelize for a business that looks like it needs all the evangelism it can get. What would I have done in his shoes?\\n\\n- Poured the pitcher and then left it for us to \\\"self serve,\\\" freeing him to other duties\\n\\n- Gotten ice for the pitcher without putting the customer in the awkward position of being the 'I am only here drinking free water, and now you're asking me if you should walk across the building on my account for some ice' guy\\n\\n- Poured a couple little taster glasses of beer and slipped them in front of us unbidden. If we turn them down, the bartender just wasted 50 cents of product. If we drink them, he's got customers for life. (\\\"Hey! I'm that bartender's best friend! He just gave me a free beer!) Local Roots, you better clear out a permanent stool at your bar for me. I love your variety of all things Florida. From carrying local beers and wines to handmade hards and deli items. Aside from the eye catching wooden bar, the unique wooden taps truly draw a passerby's attention in. While we were a bit disappointed that we couldn't score a space at the bar to enjoy our Original Sin Pear Cider, we were more than happy to get some vitamin D with our brew at one of the outdoor picnic tables. \\n\\nI could reiterate all the positive things that the reviewers before me touched upon, but what stood out in my mind is the supremely chill vibe given off by the gents running the counter. They were helpful and very efficient despite every seat being taken at the bar. I loved the homemade feeling of everything, like I was welcomed at the counter in their personal kitchen. The chalkboard with the tap listing was a bit small, but it was effective in drawing us up to the counter to take a closer look. \\n\\nI hope I can time my next visit better, so I can pick the brains of the staff and learn more about their business. Those visiting EEM, make this a pitstop on your list whether you're buying a beverage or finding something deliciously local to take home with you. We fancied ourselves a beer while munching on our grilled cheese from La Femme du Fromage (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-femme-du-fromage-orlando?hrid=6G5cYcOnpwibl63Eib6mCA) and Local Roots was able to fill that need. With local beers on tap & the option to get a flight we were able to taste several beers from around the Sunshine State. \\n\\nLoved the wooden bar! Such a cool design. While we didn't purchase anything on this visit, I did love perusing the wares of the shop and thinking about what I might need to pick up next time. If I lived around the corner in the neighborhood, this would be the perfect place to stop to pick up something for dinner. \\n\\nThe gentleman behind the bar was super friendly and didn't rush us in any way even as the crowd started to pick up around lunch time. There's plenty of seating (~15 stools) at the bar so you shouldn't have too hard a time finding a place to sit. Absolutely love this cute and local vendor at East End Market! Florida & Co. serves local craft beers as well as wine and sparkling cocktails. I'm excited to try their food menu next. Apparently you get 25% off your tab when you eat dinner here, even alcohol. Do yourself a favor and try the shrubs. It sounds weird, but they are so good. They are more of an elixir that they mix with sparkling soda or champagne. I loved the hibiscus and Mayhan the best. And if you're looking to try a different wine or beer offered, go for the flights. They are a great deal. You can bring your drinks around the market or even go outside and listen to the live band that might be there. Or just sit at the bar and enjoy some friendly conversation with Emily and Perrin. One of my favorite dishes is shrimp & grits.  The dish as prepared  by Florida & Co offers a delicious healthier option to the traditional southern dish.  Not the less in flavor, it is prepared with coconut oil and adds Swiss chard and kale along with savory shrimp and an egg on top. The ingredients are locally sourced and are fresh   It is a dish worth repeating.  The setting is so nice. You can eat outside or inside at counter seating. They serve wine and also some craft beers on draft. I Can't wait for the next time I'm visiting the area to stop in at East end Market to try it again. Florida & Co is so good it will change your mind about Orlando. It proves it's more than a city just centered around touristy Disney World and full of gross, fried food. WRONG! \\n\\nFlorida & Co is a locally sourced restaurant inside the cool East End Market that prioritizes low sugar foods. On top of that, they sell some of Florida's best craft beer and ciders.\\n\\nI ordered the Mojo bowl or lunch with brown rice, kale, sweet peppers, orange slices, and Florida wild shrimp. It was all steamed and came with a light lime garlic sauce. It was so good, healthy, and balanced the flavors well (the orange slices were perfect and, yes, you are meant to eat the orange peel).\\n\\nThe drink list is really good and they always have a local cider on tap. I ordered the acai cider from Accomplice Brewery and it was one of the best drinks I've ever had.\\n\\nOn top of that, the space is beautiful with a few tables off to the side and a long wood bar to sit at. Also, the service is excellent and friendly! Claim to be a small craft brewery specialist, doesn't even know the difference between white IPA and a pale ale... food is pretty good but owner is incompetent, decent experience but made it hard to enjoy a beer due to bad attitude. Stick too food here This place is a wonderful staple in the East end market. The last few times I've been here have been as a layover type visit- while waiting on a table at Domu or just for cheese (from the fromage) and beer but I need to change that as their menu has expanded and looks rather tasty AND healthy. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the local craft beers they have and are always willing to let you sample something before you decide. The bar front seating can be limited but they are more than willing to let you sit outside with drinks and will deliver food to you outside as well. I came here a few weekends ago with friends and it was so amazing! It's located inside East End Market so a great place to hangout on a Saturday or Sunday morning. They have ample seating space, extremely friendly employees, and a menu full of feel-good, delicious meals and snacks. I ordered the Florida Bowl with Shrimp. It did take a few minutes to prepare, but I was the first customer of the morning and they prepared everything fresh which was nice. The bowl began with a bed of rice, a hearty portion of greens, ample pickled vegetables, and a deliciously light cilantro-lemongrass sauce. Four or five large shrimp adorned the top of the bowl. \\n\\nI absolutely loved this! First of all, it was piping hot and extra comforting on a rainy morning. At $15 a bowl, you really get a perfect sized portion-- enough to feel like you've got your money's worth, but not simply loaded with cheap fillers. The cilantro-lemongrass sauce was truly a standout. A lot of times I order things with sauce on the side because they're too often heavy handed in the application, or way too oily. There was just the right amount of sauce added to this bowl and it wasn't loaded down with weird oils. Absolutely wonderful-- highly recommend! I was really excited to come to this place to try some ceviche. I'm not sure if it was the advertising , but it looks delicious. Surely enough it was. However their is always more then one aspect to a dining experience! Let's take it from the top! \\n\\nI'd like to start with the parking. Which you have to acknowledge as lackluster. It is understandable, for a market that shares space with several different kinds of businesses. However, space is available right outside of East End as it does tend to fill up quickly and for many hours on end. All within a short walking distance and free. No worries! \\n\\nFlorida and Co is located right up front on your left as soon as you enter. The aesthetic immediately captures your attention and if seafood is your thing, then it will also captures your tastebuds. Upon seating ourselves and reviewing the menus. We ordered 2 waters which were filled a quarter full each time (including the one refill). I'm not sure if that is part of the experience or not. No big deal, I finally settled upon ordering the ceviche bowl and anxiously awaited as I contained my growling stomach! \\n\\nMy favorite time arrived as I received my food within minutes and was extremely excited to eat this meal. I went with the jasmine rice option as well and really hoped for a nice heaping bowl of ceviche for $15. To my dismay, I received the bowl, minus the heaping. It turned out to be enough food for about half the actual size of the bowl. In all fairness, the food was absolutely delicious. The fish was very fresh and the acidity and lime really work well together in the ceviche. The onions are proportionate and the jasmine rice is to die for. \\n\\nA restaurant is much more than a food establishment though, it is at its heart. A service based business. I would like to mention Kristen as a very nice and helpful employee. I say this because Kristen turned out to be the only one their that morning who actually put on a nice friendly smile and sought to uphold the customer service standard. Aside from that, I must note that the service in general was bad. After paying for my purchase and putting the tablet on the table for my girlfriend to pay for her meal, the  employee across from us snatched the tablet and gives it to a couple next to me, forcing us to awkwardly wait for someone to check out before us in the middle of us checking out. That was really uncomfortable for me. I still left a tip because I appreciate the hard work small business go through and just want to show my support in anyway possible. \\n\\n\\nOverall, the food is good here. I don't warn anyone against going here. If ceviche or seafood is your thing, you might want to go for it. As for me, Unfortunately, I will not be back, but I do have high hopes for the future of this business! Their food is just amazing. Have you ever had the first bite of something and literally say \\\"OH MY GOD\\\" this is so good and just be in  over it? Lol yeah this places does that to me every time. Everyone who works there is also super nice and helpful. Love love love. If you haven't tried it you MUST! Every time I hit up East End, I always go to Gideon's and Domu. But this time I finally gave the other spots a try, which led me to the zucchini noodle bowl at Florida & Co. they're clearly capitalizing on the fad diets of New Years Resolutions, which is fine by me! The zucchini was crunchy and it soaked up that great pecan pesto sauce. Topped it with their homemade meatballs and red sauce, and I was in heaven. The bowl packed flavor and savor and it satisfied my pasta needs. We came here for another establishment but on our way out of this indoor farmers market type place we made a pit stop. My husband tried a sample of the Central 28, Upriver American Pale Ale 6%. He enjoyed it so much he went ahead and got a glass for $7.00. \\n\\nI will say their beer pairs well with Gideons cookies. 5 Stars for all of the reasons mentioned in my prior review and now some fabulous prepared food!\\n\\nThere's still the local beers, locally made products, and tasty wines, but what was once Local Roots is now Florida & Co., and it provides another great option for prepared food at East End Market.\\n\\nI took a seat at one of their round high top tables and ordered the (local meat) meatball sandwich and a rice bowl of pickled veggies, lettuce, and shrimp. Of course, I forgot to take a picture of the menu, so I don't have the official names of these dishes, but it seems like anything you order off this menu is going to be quality and full of flavor.\\n\\nThe meatball sandwich was hearty and had enough acidity to leave you feeling light afterwards. Which is the first time I can remember feeling that after a meatball sub. The rice bowl had thinly sliced pickled cucumbers, carrots, and beautiful lettuce leaves (I want to say butter lettuce, but I'm not great at identifying greens...). But the star of the dish was the shrimp. There were plenty of perfectly seasoned shrimp (no poop vein!) and a bite of pickled vegetables with shrimp is flavor perfection!\\n\\nService was great (thanks, David!) and the round tables gave more privacy for lunch meetings than when you used to only have the bar as an option. There's not as much selection in terms of produce or local gifts, but that's been replaced with really, really good food. So, overall, a great change!\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1075,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Can't comment on customer service since I just ordered online for delivery.  I would order again if I'm working in the area again. This Jimmy Johns is the worst that I've been to and I frequent them a lot. The staff are not friendly and the subs are very thin, not worth the money. Food tastes as expected (what you want from a chain). Took close to forty minutes and I was a mile away - not freaky fast. The beach club is my favorite! Awful! I ordered my food at 11:05 and didn't receive it until 1:40. Customer service was awful. The service here was horrible.  Staff is very unfriendly!  I had to tell the girl 3 times before she got my order correct and then she acted like it was my fault.  I will not be coming back.  The jalape\\u00f1o chips are good but their tuna tasted like it died a slow painful death. \\\"Freaky Slow\\\" should be this locations motto. I ordered online and 15 minutes before arriving to the store and when I got here I had to wait another 15. Very poorly managed store, absolutely ridiculous, they even have a huge staff on hand. Ok let's start by say the loud music as if I'm walking into a night club. Then I look at the menu before I get to the cash register and I stand the for a minute before I say something to the guy that is standing there and refuse to face me to take my order WTH. Then he whispers do you want cheese on that and I said yes, come to find out I was charged extra for the cheese. WHAT IS A SANDWICH WITHOUT DARN CHEESE SMH IM DONE WITH PLACE. Now for the group of employees that make the place look like a hang out spot IM DONE DROPPING THE MIC My wife and I are here with out 2 yr old son.  We each ordered a sandwich and began to eat, feeding our son from our own sandwich.  We quickly realised he was only interested in the bread so went up to grab a day old bread for 50 cents. The kind gentlemen behind the counter asked if it was for the little guy and gave it to him for free, asking if we needed any sauces on it for him.  Give the place a shot; what a kind, selfless thing to do! Nice refreshing change of pace from the old fast food burger joints. My wife and I order from here regularly. The app works great for us and the delivery is always really fast.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are always correctly put together and the quality is great. You definitely get what you pay for. \\n\\nAs a suggestion, I always ask them to \\\"take some bread out\\\" when ordering the French bread, it helps to eat the sandwhich without losing the goods. What I don't understand how people manage to hire employees with bad attitudes and let them be the face of a business.3 employees working with no smile, no greeting and bad attitude like someone killed their cat. \\nWalked up to the counter and I get greeted with \\\"whatchu want\\\". Ordered a sub an Asked for a cup of water, got a dreadful reply \\\"we are out of water cups\\\" with absolutely no sense of remorse, let alone a \\\"sorry\\\". It's like I am not giving them business, they are doing me a favor by serving me.\\nIf you hate your jobs so much, don't spoil your customer's mood with bad attitude. Go find another job or leave your f-ing attitude at home. I ordered 2 sandwiches to be delivered. 45 mins later? I'm still waiting. Apparently the B Team is working because it would have absolutely faster to drive there myself, eat, and drive back. If you order delivery...really any time of the day... expect a call telling you they either \\\"don't have bread\\\" or they'll tell you they don't have a delivery driver. Freaky fast delivery? More like freakishly unpredictable and incredibly unreliable/nonexistent delivery. Absolutely obnoxious. Food is always fresh and good, however the service is terrible.  They never get the order right and the employees are rude and not helpful.  The GM is terrible.  AVOID Terrible customer service including the manager. Had a driver yell for not getting a tip, do better the food is still great I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but this jimmy johns not only got our order wrong twice when we were in the store, we realized after we had left that they had forgotten to put meat on two of the sandwiches. The sandwich also left my stomach very unsettled making me think I got a touch of food poisoning too. This jimmy johns needs some serious improvement. I've been here several times, and every time the service has not met Jimmy Johns status. My last visit is what pushed me to write this review and to not return.\\n\\n1. The lady making my sandwich was bossy and yelling at her kids while she was making my sandwich.\\n\\n2. They locked all the doors when they closed in an hour and a half. When I was unlocking the door to leave, the same lady demandingly yelled and told me not to unlock the door. How do you except me to leave? I ignored her and opened it anyway.\\n\\n3. Same lady lied to me. When she handed me my sandwich she said the bread was hard because it just came out of the oven. But it wasn't hot. I'm a professional baker, bread is hard because you burned it or its stale. I wasn't going to complain but don't lie to me. The bread wasn't enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n4. They are slow compared to most Jimmy Johns.\\n\\n\\nDon't yell at me don't lie to me and send your kids home. I'm used to getting fast, friendly service at Jimmy John's. This place was neither of those things. I was the only customer there, so it's not like they were too busy. The lady who was making my sandwich started to make it, and then stopped so she could finish her conversation with I coworker. The sandwich wasn't put together very well. I don't expect to visit this location again. Just like the commercials say, this place is FAST.  By the time I paid and finished putting my change in my wallet they were handing me a sandwich.  I thought they were accidentally handing me someone else's... LOL\\nOn my most recent visit, I ordered The Vito.  It was noticeably fresh with decent flavor, but it could have used a little more meat and liquid (oil, vinegar, mustard, mayo). \\nIf you are pressed for time though as I was on this day, this is your perfect lunch spot. First off customer service definitely lacked. Walking in it looked like they were closed. Crew members were sitting and leaning on tables and loud music was playing. The girl that took my order was slightly rude (making a comment to a sauce I wanted on my sandwich). When wrapping up my order, the same girl that took my order reaches into the pickle jar and takes a pickle with her BARE HANDS. Ew never will I ever come back to this establishment. No one wants to spend money at a place where the employees clearly don't care. This use to be my favorite Jimmy Johns location but the quality of workers has really brought the service down.  My last visit during my transaction the cashier (named Marie ) never spoke or looked at  me once..  I'm not kidding.  I walked in she stood next the register so i started giving my order, she put her hand out for my credit card and gave me a receipt.  I have to find a new favorite location. Walked in the other day. Ordered a sandwich to go. The gentlemen who helped me were very nice and accommodating. It was my first time ever being at a JJ's and they were patient and answered all my questions Sandwich was made fresh. Since I wasn't eating the sandwich right away, I was worried about it getting soggy. Not the case. I ate half and ended saving the other half for even later and it was still fresh! Even though I didn't eat it there, still a clean establishment. I called for a delivery order at 4 pm.  The lady taking my order was more interested in talking to someone else about going on breaks.  She was VERY RUDE to me (as a paying customer) and acting like I was interrupting her.  WTF Jimmy Johns.  I know you are better than this. \\n\\nSOO.... 30 minutes later (when my order should have been delivered) the same rude woman calls me back to let me know their delivery driver will not be in for work until 5 pm.  WHY WASN'T I TOLD THIS WHEN I ORDERED????  She offers no apology or any explanation.  She advises me that I can wait until their driver shows up for work OR I can come pick it up myself.  I cancelled the order. This location will not have my business any longer. \\n\\nThis Jimmy John's is terrible and DOES NOT live up to their company standards.  It's pathetic. Customer service at this location is the worst i have ever expirienced.  \\n\\nI called in an order. I may have as well gone through  a drive through.  You know what happens there.  You get F#@#@ed. \\n\\n I   asked if my special request had been fulfilled and was told  yes.  Upon return to work i found that the request was honored but my order was worng.  \\n\\nWhen i called to complain is when the horrible service began.  That store is run by incompetent extremely rude people.\\nI was  told that there  was no way to speak with the owner of this franchise location.  No response from a call i have in to him either.   I guess the poor service is from top to bottom.   Will never go there again. I didn't get his name, but the guy with dreads fixed my sandwich. His sandwich counter was filthy and he didn't follow any directions on light mayo, light mustard etc. Super fast but that because they barely made the sandwich. Turkey sandwich what could go wrong... let me tell you. \\nI had to search for the lettuce due to such a small amount even a friend asked if I ordered no lettuce. There was more mayo than turkey, I guess 1 slice of turkey is the spec because the whole office enjoyed their bread and mayo experience.  But it was fast.  Increase your quality and not just speed. I called in my order and when I got there girl was cleaning down and never made my food. Took off cleaning glove picked up new glove and made my tuna sandwich. But she was stoned and store smelled like trees, they had the door open. I walked into pot lounge. Never going back Horrible customer service and unprofessional delivery driver. Why would you call a customer to complain about an accidental tip online. You never know what someone has waiting on you IN CASH! Oh and they hang up on you too. Never give this location business. Hopefully they all lose their jobs in the next few months. I think Jimmy John's has a pretty good product. The meat is pretty fresh, as well as the lettuce. Their bread is pretty tasty too. You can expect to pay $7 and change for a sandwich or $11 and change for a combo. If their prices were a tad bit cheaper I'd say it's worth five stars. All in all it's a convenient, healthy option for lunch! Worst seen to date!! Ordered online and the app showed that it was made and out for delivery within 20 min... well, after an hour I called and they said they had to bake the bread and it was cooling and that they would make it in about 10 min. It was finally delivered 1 hr and 40 min after it was ordered. Almost TWO hours for a sandwich!!! WOW... This is the absolute worst Jimmy John's I've ever been to.  They are very slow, customer service is terrible, they can't make a sandwich like you ordered if their life depended on it.  They argue with you if you call them out on their error and insist you are wrong...  Um.... I'm the customer, remember?  I used to go here every week, but I don't think I'll be back unless there's a real turnover in employees.  It's a real shame too. Went to Jimmy Johns after work because nothing else was open for vegans around that area. This was around 9:20p. I got the veggie club. They started making the sandwich and said they were out of tomato. I said \\\"you don't have any at all?\\\". She was like yea but they're in the back and I would have to cut it. (With a attitude) She then looked at the time like I was wasted her time to close and clean up. This staff has always been over it and looked like they don't want to work there. Not surprising really. Giving two stars because she actually cut the tomato for me, attitude and all.\",\n          \"Food was adequate for what it was. My boyfriend ordered a Mojito, they had no mint, said nothing and instead ended up with what tasted like crystal light, vodka and too much lime juice....not terribly interested in returning. This is a dive that I used to go to, but do not anymore because of a proximity factor. As I said it is just a dive to meet and chat, have a drink with friends, and so expectations not being to high, it never really disappoints. Service is kind of lacking sometimes. I was happy with the Nachos. Wish there was more cheese on it. But the guacamole was top notch!\\n\\nHeads UP: They have a 50 cent charge for take out. Cheap drinks, lots of room, realy friendly bar tender, cheap pool, and lots of fun alcoholics. so cute. really close to the max and a great haven to escape from the crazies on skidmore. WTF.... Had to pay for food before even ordered ...Hmmm ever been to burger king if so EAT ThERE service is better and the food with out  a thought 10000 times better.\\nAs for service stay away from the bartender Joe just a wipe we brought my partner's parents here and had the veggie s/m burger with salad. my partner had the eggs benedict, and they shared the french dip with fries. everything was delicious, and the server was so friendly and efficient. love the atmosphere. Went in for lunch during the week and sat in a booth far away from the bar.  I think all the action was at the bar because we never got any service.  When we first sat down someone asked us what we would like and we said we needed a minute. Then no one ever came back.  After a while we just got up and left and ate some place near by because being ignored made us feel awkward and I didn't want to go ask for service and seem rude.  I'm just too passive to eat here. This is my fav lunch and dinner spot. The service is too notch and the food is excellent. There is a new owner who is committed to the bar and her employees. I really appreciate her commitment as a regular. They have switched up the menu and introduced craft cocktails! I recommend coming down to this spot for lunch, dinner or happy hour. I hear the brunch is spot on also I am excited for Pride! The place will be packed! I had no idea this bar was over here. In this side of town you just get used to your usual places unless you live downtown, work there or spend way too much time in bars...no offense...everyone needs hobbies right. I love the decor which seemed pretty butch and no dive bar at all - I was confused as to the reviews mentioning it as a dive since that was not the impression I got at all though I hear they went through a remodel. The staff were amazing and when we went there with a Barfly bus filled with 40 they slammed our drink orders out smoking fast. The drinks were well priced and well made too. Nothing screamed gay bar at all and there was a birthday party happening with catering and everything which was neat - that they can section off parts like that. My boyfriend and I frequent this bar, but not just for the drinks.  We are both big fans of the food.  Attention is paid to the quality of the meals you get and the prices are reasonably low for the the amount they serve you.  The service tends to be kind of spotty, a bit of a hit or miss sort of thing, but there are a few waiters/bartenders that make it all the more worth it to stop in.  It is conveniently located just off the max line and is very easy to find if you know what you are looking for, though we found that we had actually walked by the place several times without even being aware of it's existence.  It is relatively conservative inside on the decor, and not nearly as in-your-face as something like The Eagle, but you still sense a presence of acceptance and tolerance.  It is not uncommon to see men dressed as women at the bar ordering a drink and talking to the bartenders as old friends.  It's a welcoming environment.\\nMy only suggestion for the place would be to hire on a new waiter or two.  There have been several times my boyfriend and I have gone in and had to wait an unusually long time to have our orders taken, or to get our check.  We don't mind too much, especially considering there is typically 1-2 people working as bartenders and doubling as waiters.  It isn't there fault, I just hope that management notices that many of their customers aren't as tolerant to their short-staffed nature as my boyfriend and I are.  \\nAll in all, this place is a good time with great food.  Check it out when you're not in a hurry and ask about the specials-some of them are REALLY great deals.  Cheers! Absolutely HORRIBLE service!!!! Refused to give us water unless we bought alcohol first! Completely outrageous behavior from the bartender, will never go there again. Have never been treated so horribly I've been to Fox & Hounds a handful of times now, and each time it's the same bartender. That's comforting. It's a nice, \\\"old man bar\\\" - but, there aren't a lot of old men here, generally speaking. For a nice, quiet gay bar, I highly suggest this place. If C.C. Slaughters is too loud for you to talk, pop on in to Fox & Hounds and have a few drinks. \\n\\nThey have a pretty extensive menu, as well - including your old standby's of fried bar food. The French Dip is simple but quite good. The Jalapeno Poppers are a favorite. The Chicken Strips and Fries are quite sufficient and tasty. \\n\\nOne pool table, lots of seating, friendly establishment. The location to the dance club of Slaughters night life is perfect. I'd definitely try stopping in and not let previous reviews strip you of the opportunity to support this local establishment. A couple weeks ago, my friend and I went to Fox & Hounds for the Ladies of Rock drag show fundraiser for various charities. We got there super early and the servers were very attentive. My friend and I had just eaten dinner somewhere else and weren't really looking to order anything food/ drink wise, so we tried to stay under the radar with the ordering. Eventually the place filled up and we didn't have to keep saying we were waiting for friends to order. Anyway, I would definitely come here again for another drag show. I'm glad I didn't drink because the unisex bathrooms were kind of gross (why can't boys pee IN the toilet?) and I didn't want to have to go again. That's my only real criticism... I would not waste your time or money at The Fox & Hounds.  I went there with a friend the other night to grab some food and a beer.  The restaurant from the street looked inviting and the atmosphere pleasant.  We sat ourselves, per instruction from the sign in the entrance, and waited for our server.  We waited and waited and waited.  20 minutes later our server, real short hair and balding, pale in complection and rocking 2 tattooed arm sleeves, came over to us and apologized for the wait saying he didn't see us.  I wasn't sure how that could be as we were sitting in direct line of sight.  No problem, I'll take his word for it and let it go.  We got our menus and ordered beers right away.  20 minute wait made us thirsty.  Our server proceeded to take a beverage order for a table of 8 next to us.  Then he shot back up to the bar and began doing I don't know what.  At one point he removed his shirt to expose his white tank-top undershirt.  A little classless but whatever- I'm not judging.  10 minutes later the server came over with drinks in his hands for the table of 8.  That was the last straw for me and we got up and left.  Upon exiting the server asked us \\\"oh, are you guys leaving?\\\" Either he had no clue of his poor customer service on display or he just didn't really want to serve us.  Whatever way you look at it, it was poor poor service.  I wish I could comment on the food but we didn't get that far.  Portland has many, many food options and The F&H is not worth your time! It's not a busy Saturday afternoon but, a lot of dirty tables. Every ketchup bottle was almost empty it took three to get enough for my fries. Plus the bottles were all dirty. Napkins were non existent. No line at the bar but, I had to wait over five minuets to get a Coke while the bartender chatted with his friend. \\nBartender was super nice & food is improved over the old management but, some serious side work etc needs to be taken into consideration. One bus tub and about five minuets would have had the dining room looking neat. I hit Fox's regularly. It's like \\\"Cheers\\\" for the Portland gay crowd.  Food is reasonable and good, drinks are strong, and the atmosphere is warm, inviting, friendly.  Friday happy hour is great. The ambience is Cheers-esque, which happened to be playing on the tv above the bar when I was there for lunch recently. It's neighborhoody. There are regulars. The bartender learns your name. The service is very good--the bartender who is also the waiter during the day is warm without being over the top. He's sincere, low-key, and consistent.\\nThe food is actually pretty good. Some things shine--like their daily soups. The beer and cheese soup that I had was one of the best beer and cheese soups I've ever had. And their grilled cheese is just like mom used to make. On the surface, it's a three star joint. But something about it keeps inviting me back. So I'll throw it another star for that ineffable 'come back' quality. Been to this restaurant before, food and atmosphere were not anything special. Now, on their menu, they are blaming increased prices on new minimum wage laws. I will not in any way support a restaurant that takes worker protections out on their own employees. I feel bad for those people. Your employer is clearly terrible and you should probably seek new employment. Shame on you, Fox and Hounds. I will never return to your establishment and will encourage my friends, family and colleagues to do the same. If you have a problem with local laws, take it out on your legislators, not on your workers and the community. That was nice bar... Good taste ... Meeting friend and drink and eat .. Kind of relaxing place to go there ... The bartender is surprisingly rude & slow despite there being 9 people here not ordering, just listening to shitty 80's music and being old/bitter. \\n10ish minutes after ordering, they told us they didn't have the ingredients for what we ordered, and were uppity when we asked to see the menu again. They messed up my order, and what I got was an over-priced, dried out travesty. And everyone 45+ and/or bitter lesbian/gay got better service than us (young gays), point of order: came in after us, got food before us. That autistic guy isn't lying! And their fugly regulars decided to chime in when my friend had a \\\"difficult\\\" vegetarian order (#SorryNotSorry it's 2015 and you live in Portland). Not coming back. Good food, inexpensive drinks.  The dinner special on Friday was Prime Rib for $12.50!  How could you pass that up?\\n\\nI rarely had to wait at the bar for service, the bartender was friendly. Until last night, I had only been to Fox and Hounds once with a friend for a quick stroll through and once during Pride Week when everyone was drunk and acting crazy. \\nLast night, a friend and I went for happy hour and dinner.  This area of town seems to be really calm and slow until later at night, which is cool, if you just want a relaxed time.  There were maybe two other people when we arrived around 4:30 and then maybe four tables of people when we left.  \\nThe drinks were good and strong.  I had  crispy chicken salad, which was really good.  The chicken wasn't heavily battered and the salad had lots of different veggies.  I forgot to ask for no cheese as I'm trying to avoid dairy and they don't put any on it anyway, so I was happy.  My friend's club sandwich looked really good and he said it was. Prices were very reasonable. \\nThe bartender was low key, not super friendly but mellow.  I'd definitely recommend Fox and Hounds if you just want a mellow drink or meal, I've no idea what the later crowd is like. Well, the decor was beautiful, the food fantastic.  The bar staff was about as friendly and courteous as a plague infected rat.  Go there for the ambiance and the food, but don't except the welcoming committee...it doesn't exist there Small kitchen means you might be waiting for 4 tacos for 50 minutes on a Tuesday... that's with the bar at half capacity. I know there is a new owner and I think she would be best served by simplifying the menu. It is better to do a few things really well, than to do a lot of things slightly better than poorly. It's the only bar open for lunch in the area, they have a real opportunity to be a draw. I'll keep my fingers crossed. Worst experience ever. Just got into town & was looking for a quick meal & drink before a show downtown. This place liked decent and had customers inside, so I entered...I was gonna wet myself as I was finishing my coffee I'd been drinking during the trip so I immediately went into the restroom before making my way toward the bar (a sign in the entryway said \\\"Please seat yourself\\\" and there was no greeter). As I did a gentleman approached & said \\\"Hey man when you came in here you broke about 3 of my rules. You didn't talk to any of us, you had a backpack on, and you have a drink in your hand. Now get your ass out the door now!\\\" I tried explaining that I'd never been there so didn't know about \\\"his rules\\\", nor did I think I had to speak to anyone since the sign said seat yourself. However, anytime I tried to speak he just yelled \\\"Out the door\\\" over & over, louder & louder. Needless to say, I won't be coming here again & neither should you! Rude gay bar. I am straight and don't mind patronizing any business.  They have a beautiful bar and nice happy hour. The bartender, however, made me feel unwelcome. He was talking to other gay customers about an orgy he attended the night before. I really didn't care but decided to leave for a quieter place. After tipping him I turned to leave and he called me breeder.\\n\\nThe food menu is good. Yes, strong drinks, but do I have to deal with a rude waiter? This place should not discriminate against anyone, but I guess my Aspergers is not accepted here. I asked a couple simple questions and received rude responses and then I was targeted to receive my food last and only after I asked where my food was. Then I didn't get my bill when I asked. I won't be back if he is around. Fox and the Hounds has the honor of being my first 1 star review . If you haven't been through the gauntlet to be a regular, or aren't a rude mouthy lesbian, over the age of 40, or a desperate gay alcoholic, no reason to come here, unless you're craving bowling ally food, without the bowling ally. \\nDefinitely NOT a place everyone in the gay community can feel welcome, as a gay 20 something, I was absolutely appalled by the customer service. \\nI'm a hairstylist, so patron interactions are the single most important thing for me when it comes to my dining experience, and this was the worst I've ever had. I killed him with kindness to find the bartender had a headache, and was stressed from calling the cops on a drunk/over served 90 y/o regular.\\n I would give the place 2 stars because he wasn't feeling so great, but I have never been treated so horribly! And then another regular, a large butch women mocked me for my \\\"complicated\\\" order ( a veggie burger with no cheese or mayonnaise) I knew she was a regular because she asked about the bartenders recent vacation. \\nIt's almost laughable! How is this place still in business?! I live on the NW park blocks, and have been looking for a relaxed place to come to that wasn't the atmosphere of C.C's. Unfortunately, the search continues, and I'll make sure to let my friends and clients know where to NOT go for a good time. Wow! What has happened to Fox and Hound? I just went there for dinner, and it was horrible. First the blonde bimbo bartender was too busy talking to the three people that were at the bar but finally I ordered a drink. Told her I'd be at the table and I want to dinner. Literally the cook had to tell her that I was ready to order. I waited and waited for my salad which I asked for no onions. Finally the cook brought out my dinner and I had to tell him what about my salad. I got my salad covered in onions after my dinner was brought out. Got the chicken fried steak dinner it was so salty I could not even finish it. Then I had to go up to the bar to get my bill because she never came back over to the table. And she actually asked me \\\"oh did you have to drinks?\\\" Fox and Hound a hard no. Is this place even a gay establishment anymore? Apparently there is a new owner. She needs to work on customer service and the menu and hiring the right people. I give Fox & Hounds 4 out of 5 stars mainly because of the staff, who are very friendly and accepting of everyone. They make newcomers feel like regulars. \\n\\nIt is primarily a gay bar, but you could bring business clients there for lunch and never know it was a gay bar. Tasteful, conservative decor. Lots of straight people enjoy it as well. A good place to bring mixed sexuality groups, without making anyone feel uncomfortable. \\n\\nIf rated for their food, the score would be one star lower, I'm afraid. They rely too much on frozen, fried food. That having been said, though, their food is better than most bar food, and sometimes they really hit a home style daily special out of the park. And, their hamburgers are very reliable. Not quite gourmet burgers, but better than your average bar fare.\\n\\nThey have a Sunday brunch that is quite good if you arrive early and the food is still fresh. A friend and I stopped at this place today, Sat, Apr 26, '14, at about 3 pm.\\n\\nFood was ok, not great.  Drinks were a bit weak.\\n\\nBut the bartender (slender, about 48-49, short hair) was RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!!  No wonder there were only 3 other people there. came in here to escape the rain. drinks were strong and the bartender was great - good service and friendly. my boyfriend most definitely attracts the gay male population in portland as he got chatted up on the street numerous times, it's almost like we were attracted to this bar by divine intervention ;) I literally couldn't believe it..... Saturday of Portland Pride weekend, the place was packed, and the management had allotted ONE front of the house employee- the bartender!! \\n\\nI will never go back, because of their extremely poor showing on Pride. A gay bar? There's plenty better queer dives in this town. Horrible SERVICE! & Rude.... not personable at all... was frowned at and glared at while ordered food & i brought family in to eat and have a cocktail.. Gurllll.. shameful.. I am very very disappointed in this place! It's in a great location near CC Slaughters so you would think this place would have more business. This place could be great. Sadly the service suck! Specially the old bitch cranky bartender!  What is up with his diva attitude! He's chasing away customers and thanks to him business is going down for them! I would hope the owner would realize this place could be great with out crappy service! Just remember have a bad experience ill tell 10 people, have a great experience I will come back and bring people in! Your move! So my friend and I needed to use a bathroom bad! We popped in here and she went in while I waited my turn, the bartender came over and said \\\"we have 2 more bathrooms in back. He was so friendly we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink. I don't mind that the place was mostly a gay bar, even though we were obviously not. He was really nice and welcoming. I will definitely recommend The Fox and Hounds. Cute place and super chill. love it.  It's your total comfort food place if you ever need one.  It's a great queer place to hang out at as well.  Drinks are made strong, which is good!\\n\\nThe staff was great and the prices were pretty reasonable for the amount of food that you get!  Plus they are open super super late! A very low-key gay bar. Perfect environment for the gay community, but without the extremes. Good food, fair prices. I work right across the street from Fox & Hounds.  During the summer months when I go outside to eat my lunch I always see people from the company I work for go and eat at this establishment.  I often wondered why so many people went over there.  Is it a convenience factor?  Is the food really that good?  What gives?  Well, after all these years of working in this neighborhood I decided it was time to see what the deal was.  I took a colleague of mine out for lunch here and another gem was found.\\n\\nFirst off the food here is very affordable.  Most of their sandwiches are under $8.  This is not an $8 sandwich that you get at some of the sandwich shops in town that come with nothing and you laugh at how small it is.  This is a good sized sandwich that comes with a side (salad, fries, cup of soup?).  My colleague had heard that the Chicken Cordon Bleu ($7.25) sandwich was really good here.  That is what we both ended up ordering.  That and a few drinks (of the non-alcoholic variety as it was a work day) got me out the door for only $21.\\n\\nThe sandwich was very tasty.  The chicken was nice and moist and the bun that came along for the ride lasted throughout that ride.  I wanted to be a good boy and get a salad and was quite happy that it was pretty big.  Very good bang for your buck.\\n\\nFox & Hounds is also a bar that I believe caters mostly to the gay crowd.  Not that you have to be gay to come here.  I imagine it gets pretty lively here at nights and on weekends.  I know it as a place to get a sandwich or a burger that won't break the bank.  Now I know and knowing is half the battle. At first I thought this place looked like a spin off a rustic saloon, but then I realized it was just old and dirty. I've been here a couple times and (I hate to say it) ordered the same thing. Each time it looked completely different. Zero consistency. The bartenders are nice, but they go out for smoke breaks often and one of them had a \\\"shift drink\\\" (or shot, more like) during his shift. I see the potential, but definitely needs work. Good atmosphere and good priced drinks. Solid cheeseburger and french dip. My wife and I didn't even realize it was a gay bar until halfway through our meal. I'd go back for another french dip. It was late on a Friday night.  We were looking for a quiet place for an after-the-show get-together.  One of our friends highly recommended Fox & Hounds, stating something about the bartender always excited to them, so we took the small stroll over.\\nFrom the outside, it looked like the ambiance we were looking for.  Relaxed, pool tables in the corner for casual games, and a bat half filled with patrons.  The transition inside was not what I was expecting, which was the loud music which made things really difficult for me.  Everyone else seemed to be able to communicate just fine over the blaringly obviously iTunes playlist on shuffle that played on the speaker system; for me though, I just gave up taking part of any conversation and just wish the night would end and go home. Used to like this place. New owners, new name. The rainbow flag is gone. Using the restroom requires asking for a key attached to a ridiculously large tchatchke. The tchatchke was disgustingly filthy. Like using the restroom at a Texaco. I ordered the fish and chips. The menu said ling cod. I got frozen Atlantic cod. Major difference. The coleslaw was old enough to vote, it was rotten and translucent. My husband got the Cordon Bleu. He still smells like onions. ONIONS! The fries were ok, large steak fries but the ketchup was obviously married and I didn't want to play shigellosis roulette. A sports themed bar with shitty food is really the last thing Old town/Chinatown needs at this point. Especially one that ignores the neighborhood demographics. Good luck Second Ave Sports Bar, you're gonna need it. Giving this place 5 stars because there is a new owner that is working hard to make things better. It is worth coming down again to check out since I think most people have forgotten about this place. Menu has been slimmed down to a more manageable selection. Food service at this time is still a little slow to get out orders. This is a bit of a problem during the weekday lunch hour since most people downtown are on a schedule and need to get in and out and back to work.  I think after a few of the kinks and growing pains are worked out this will be a downtown hangout worth coming back to. Came in yesterday for a quick drink before catching the train to the airport. Quiet, local gay bar. I encountered a nice bartender who pointed me in the right direction to the train stop, so I'm kind of surprised by the negative Yelp reviews as I didn't experience anything remotely like what I've read. Very fun, good food, casual, just up the street from more touristy places. Friendly crowd and staff. Beautifully remodeled, nice and dimly lit with a warm and cozy atmosphere complemented with friendly and attitudeless service.   I find this place great for relaxing with a beer and a shot after work.  Far cry from yesteryear when the establishment was frequented by loud over weight, unattractive, tweakers/drunks with personalities equal to that of underwatered houseplants.  Good moderately priced menu.  I would frequent this place more often if the pool table was less than seventy-five cents per game......or even  free!! Ate here before and enjoyed it, returned recently and I gotta say putting a sticker on your menu saying \\\"due to mimimum wage increases everything on the menu is +$1\\\" is also saying \\\"I'd literally pay my workers less than this if the government would let me\\\" or \\\"I don't care about my employees, so they won't care about the quality of your food.\\\" \\nNever coming back and advising other to not eat here! This is a quiet, relaxing place.  I like that!  If you're looking for loud music and a raucous atmosphere, this isn't the place for you.  But it's a very pleasant place with reasonable prices on food and drink.  Just one word of advice..  if you order steak or prime rib, ask for it to be cooked rare.  They seem to overcook the beef here until it's dry and tasteless. I have had really bad experience here.. But I am updating my review based on my experience with a bartender named Matt... Really awsome... Visit the ba when he is around! This is a nice place to grab a sandwich and a draft beer. Gay friendly, but not all gay. We went on a monday (yesterday eve). It was Labor Day, not crowded at about 5:30pm. My first time there. I got the rueben sandwich and a salad (instead of fries). Salad was crisp and fresh, rueben was good but note that there is very little meat in the sandwich but it was still ok. It was $8 or $7.something.  A friend got the mac and cheese with bacon. A lot of food and very good, but a tad pricey at $9. The 3rd in our group got the Monday special: a small steak, baked potato, brocolli, and side salad all for $9,50. Very good deal. The service was VERY slow. The bartender was also the server. He was busy talking with the two guys sitting at the bar or going outside to smoke to give us any decent service. But who is in a rush? Glad we weren't. So don't get the rueben til they start putting more meat but the other meals, the atmosphere, all worth it. h and maybe don't go on mondays...get a different server that way. we had a rough week, and had been meaning to come here for some time. we came for lunch 12-22-12. began with a bloody mary, and a corona. next, i chose the veggie s. and m. burger on wheat with a salad and oil/vinegar. my partner had the traditional s. and m. burger with fries. the drinks hit the spot, and the food was delicious. our server/bartender was the best...he was so efficient, funny, friendly, and very customer-focused...we will be back...thx so much... Atmosphere here is great, there is a pool table for those that are interested.  My server was very friendly and funny. My only complaint (which is kinda silly), is the well vodka is foul.  I'm not a picky drinker and order well often, but I ordered a drink and a friend did also, both of us could barely choke it down.  Neither were made incorrectly... they were definitely what we ordered, but the vodka was a little odd... almost bitter.  I can't really fault the establishment though, because you can simply choose another brand of vodka; I would recommend they look into switching that out though and again, I'm really not picky with that stuff.  We will definitely be back! I have gone a couple of time in the past year to Fox & Hounds (little bar/food joint) because it is conveniently located near my job.  It's a dive but I continue to go.  Everytime I go the service is late.  This last time I went is the LAST time I will ever go!!!  Let me break it down for you...\\n\\nI walk in and the waiter (they only have one) looks me directly in the face as I walk myself to a booth.  He continues to take care of the table he is serving at the time.  He walks around the bar and walks behind the bar and gets their drinks ready.  He continues to go back to their table with their drinks and will not look at me...keep in mind I'm right behind him.  He walks back to give the cook their orders and then walks behind the bar to chitchat w/the barflies.  I'm staring him down the WHOLE time.  He then goes and gets their food from the cook area.  At that time I go and get my own menu!  I walk back to my booth and he's right behind me!!!  He serves that last table with their food and goes back behind the bar to chitchat.  Finally...20 minutes later he comes over as if nothing is wrong.  He has stupid smile on his face like he knows he should apologize!!!  But he doesn't!  By this time my date (fiance) had shown up and we order.  By the time we are get our food we eat a couple of bites and have to box it up and leave!  Never once did he apologize or anything.  I have, like I said, been to this place a couple of times and every time I feel like I don't get the service that I deserve!!! Cheap good food.  Besides just being across the street from work, the best part about going there is Jeff, the bartender.  LOVE him.  I've only been there for lunch during work, so I haven't tried any drinks, but the food is good for bar food. DO NOT GO HERE\\n\\n(To the owner, feel free to get in contact with us)\\n\\nseriously we used to be regulars and have gone to this bar for over a DECADE!\\n\\nThis is the last time we will ever go to this bar. \\nYou had many chances and disappointed our group every Sunday for the last couple months.\\n\\nIt's Sunday and we called around 2pm, told them a large group of us will be showing up again. (usually ends up being around 10-15 people, plus others who join us and some who leave during our regular meet-ups) They told us they would be open their POSTED HOURS.\\n\\n(That means you were supposed to be open until 11 every Sunday night)\\n\\n we got there and the lights were off and doors locked, it's now only 6:50pm.\\n\\nThe last time we all tried to meet here, (we meet every Sunday here around 7pm) they told us they were no longer serving food for the day because the grill kept catching fire. (Ok I guess)\\n\\nBut then we ordered fried food and eventually (after three orders of only being able to choose from french fries or tater tots, are you kidding me!?) they told us they were no longer doing fried food either!\\n\\nI'm more then sure at this point, as is the rest of the group, they just didn't want to make food.\\n\\nThey closed an hour and half EARLY last Sunday\\nAn hour early the Sunday prior. \\nAnd many times before that.\\n\\nI work in the service industry, I UNDERSTAND wanting to go home, however I suck it up since I chose the field and job. I work 50/60+ hours a week so I really really understand that. But as a manager who covers shifts and volunteers to close, no matter how slow it might get, I ALWAYS stay open. ALWAYS have everything stocked and KNOW my inventory!\\n\\nIF ITS ON THE MENU,  YOU SERVE IT. PERIOD.\\n\\nDONT LET YOUR KITCHEN STAFF COME UP TO THE FRONT OF THE BAR COMPLAINING THAT SOMEONE GOT THEM SWISHER SWEETS INSTEAD OF SOME OTHER CIGARETTES WHILE CURSING LOUDY IN FRONT OF YOUR GUESTS.\\n\\nHOLY MOLY LADY! GOSH HECKIE YOUR STAFF IS A JOKE. \\n\\nFrom one business owner to another. The biggest regret I had when I bought my restaurant was not letting go of staff members who kept dragging it down and had repeated customer service issues. (Everyone gets a second chance) Eventually I let them go and I actually saw a lot of my regulars returning to me. \\n\\nYou should probably let some people go and start covering shifts yourself. Who knows, you might get customers back. \\n\\nI hope other customers step up and complain so you know what the in the world is going on at your bar.\\n\\nGet your staff and your service back in order.\\n\\nYou have lost a large group of customers and although we will be open to talking about a bunch of issues, we will not be returning to this bar again. That's a minimum of 10+ people your staff has alienated. I always knew Fox & Hounds to be a gay dive bar on the level that the Dirty Duck was, so I never really gave it a chance.  Recently a colleague of mine said she loved to go there after work, which I found odd given how I just described the place.  But yesterday I found myself there for some pool and cheap drinks (Hot Toddies for $5.50) and a friendly crowd.   \\n\\nTo me it still seems apparently gay, but I guess I'm a little more in tune with the cues.  My straight colleagues still enjoy themselves, as it should be.  It doesn't feel divey or dirty at all, probably due to their recent remodel.  I know I'll be back here for drinks with co-workers and some good games of pool. F&H is an unassuming sexless gay bar, where they pour cheap, strong drinks, the regulars are hardcore drinkers and the decor and  lighting are atrocious (akin to a Shari's). Fried food, bad music,  tube TV's and video poker add to the ambiance. \\n\\nIn sum, it's too brightly lit,  the vibe is lackluster, the dicks are limp but the drinks ARE stiff.\\n\\nL'Chaim! I'm feeling nice so giving them three stars because things turned around in the last year for me here. I've often wondered what I need to do in order to get half decent service here. It's taken me nearly five years and they treat me better, but still, worse than Denny's.\\n\\nThanks for having such a big menu, there are some edible things on it, which is more than most gay places in this town. I've got stories though... Moldy fried food, and a taco with a raw corn tortilla? Imagine trying to eat that?\\n\\nI go there because my friends who have been around longer go there and they have more money, flirt with the staff and tip them big. I guess that's how it's done... Echoing what the previous reviewers said...total dive bar.  However,  I had a really great experience there and plan on going back when I come back to Portland.  The staff were all friendly and attentive, my drink did not stay empty long without one of the servers asking if I needed another (yes please!).  The drinks themeselves were strong and cheap (ahhh the way I like em!), the food was decent considering the dive-y-ness of the place, the music was fun and the patrons were also friendly and a lot of fun.  There were four of us in our party, and we escaped with plenty of drinks and nibbles for under $60.00, which was worth an additional star. I have been going to the Fox and Hound for over 20 years and always had a good time and ran into lots of friend.  WHAT HAPPENED!!!  Does not feel like a gay bar anymore and Friday nights are dead!  What happened to our friendly bartender- Joe.  Always had great service and a good time.  The last 2 Fridays were horrible!!!! Don't know if I will go back! I have been to the Fox and Hounds a few times and have never been disappointed. I am not a \\\"sit at the bar type a guy\\\" so all my experience comes from sitting at the normal tables. The food, drinks, and service has always been extremely good. As with any place, challenges do arise. However, the one time that it did, the staff was extremely apologetic and took care of the problem right away. As with all the other reviews, the place is beautiful and very inviting to all. Thank you, Fox and Hounds. I will definitely keep coming back. I went here to meet someone for brunch.  To my surprise it was pretty nice.  I had an omelet and coffee for $8.which is a really low price for what you get.\\n\\nThe waiter was a bit absent minded, but it kind of gave the place character.  \\n\\nThe place is a staple low cost place to eat for the local gay community.\\n\\nThis is located just one block from the Chinatown/downtown stop on the Red or Blue MAX light rail trains. Always a favorite place for a good, solid, simple weekend breakfast without the Portland brunch wait. Excellent service. Generous cocktails. Affordable. And, yes, it's a gay bar but we straights are made perfectly welcome. Super nice people. And yes, you may have to maneuver around a couple of street people, but that's Old Town Portland. All good! When I say we get around.. we get around.. ;) Stopped in here Friday night after we couldn't get into the other place we planned so we had to pass the place we were supposed to go and ended up in this place. Had a few drinks in here, the atmophere was nice and friendly. Had a great time just kicking back and having a few. While I would have liked to go dancing.. thats ok.. I can be just as at home in a place like this if not more. \\n\\nI love pursuing downtown when you don't have a car to worry about.. you just from place to place and then you figure out where to catch the max and go home! So much easier and you frequent lots of bars that way too. Just walk from one to the next.. no problem! Would go in here again. They really do look after thier customers! Fox & Hounds is one of those places that's set off from the main path and once you find it, you're glad it is. The atmosphere is pleasant even when it's filled with regulars. It's a great place to grab a beer or a bite and read a book or just be alone with your thoughts but it's also a great place to gather with friends. \\n\\nService is prompt and efficient and provided by a warm, friendly staff. I've never felt rushed here even when they're visibly busy. You're given the feeling that you are your servers' or bartenders' only customer and these days, that kind of service is a rare find. \\n\\nThe menu is descriptive and offers better than the average bar fare. Try the Mac n Cheese with bacon...creamy goodness served with your choice of soup or salad. Generous portions so anticipate taking half your meal home with you. \\n\\nDrinks are cheap and strong. I know what you're thinking, nuff said! This place sucks. I asked for shots for my friends and was told that the bartender didn't \\\"feel like making shots\\\" so we were only allowed beers. What kind of bar does that? He also told us that if we ended up at his bar, we were probably kicked out of a club nearby. Not true at all for our crew, but I guess that's the type of crowd this bar attracts...\\n\\nNo wonder this bar is huge and only has two people other than us on a Friday night. After my second offensive attempt to have a drink at CC's (see my review), I discovered this gem of a bar.  I can't recommend it enough.\\n\\nNice decor, super bartender's, hot looking AND friendly customers, and an above par drink.\\n\\nWhat more can you ask for? Havent been here in awhile. Found out its under new management. Prices are still low drinks are still good. New menu. New pool tables.Gotta love this place. Like with any gay bar in Portland, don't expect attentiveness on your first few visits - unless you are really cute. Bartenders are efficient, not unfriendly and pour a good drink. The beer taps are probably pretty average for Portland and likely will provide something palatable for discerning beer drinkers. \\n\\nIf you hang around the bar a bit you'll notice that the bartenders and some of the regular customers can get rather catty at times - particularly when the odd unknowing group of apparently straight people walk in the door. This can be off-putting or enjoyable depending on your tastes. However, it all seems pretty harmless and just in fun.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty comprehensive and VERY inexpensive. I have tried a few items on the menu and been impressed with the quality. The cook is really very good.  \\n\\nThe place is comfortable, there are several TVs. Don't expect to catch the latest sporting event though. Fine by me. \\n\\nIt really is a nice place to check out particularly with a group of friends. Grab a table if you are seeking a semi-private conversation. Sit at the bar if you enjoy eaves-dropping on (or participating in) the cattiness. Fox & Hounds has been a starting place, mid-party rehydration station, and last stop to some of my best evenings in Portland.  The place is dark and divy, but the staff are always friendly and cheerful.  They make a STRONG long island which is a necessity on any night out in Portland.  It is within walking distance to events like Blow Pony and places like CC Slaughters and Whiskey Bar.  In the middle of the night when you and your friends need a mini break from the party, another drink, and a clean bathroom, go to Fox & Hounds.  Pull up a chair, share a drink, and get a little quality chat time in with your friends before rejoining the party. If you want a place to dine that is fabulous in all areas, make your way to Fox And Hounds.  Great food and fabulous people. Wow!!!!! I posted some photos of Rick and Jeff. These guys make a restaurant experience memorable  Thanks Rick for the awesome service Can't believe the service tonight.  Girl behind the bar seemed off possibly on something or had been drinking.  It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to to get a drink or bottle of beer. We usually come in on Saturday nights and the bartender who has worked there for years and should be experienced is slow and more interested in idle chit chat than serving customers! Leaving won't be back! First time here, and my last. Sat at the bar, and was forced to witness the drunken owner verbally abuse and humiliate his staff in front of a a bar full of customers. As a customer service business owner myself, I was shocked to see an owner behave this way. I heard from a regular customer seated next to me that this happens often here, and that they can't keep staff as a result. I'm surprised this place hasn't been busted by the OLCC since the owner is drunk while on the premises. The food was good, though, and the staff did their best, given who they have to work for. This place has solid food and the the new owner is proactive to to say the least. and I know they've been going through a lot of changes. I've worked in the industry long enough to know things get weird and unpredictable. It's a good bar don't bitch about food issues. If you can't afford a nice brunch or steak at real restaurant that doesn't those things don't bitch about the BAR you are sitting in. Have a drink chill out...Jim... maybe have a more understanding humble point of view...coming from a church goer.\",\n          \"Beer menu is limited but decent, food items are fresh and delicious. Ambient is comfy and spacious, prices are OK for the area. Great FL Beer selection. Friendly bar service and nice fresh vegetables to go. I like this place a lot! We have had beer so many times from here. But honestly we get wine and charceuterie from la femme de Fromage. Unfortunately they disappointed us so we sat at Florida and co. Wonderful experience with perky staff (Jennifer) and good alternative food option from houndstooth The food is amazing. The drinks are great craft brews and mimosas. The environment is chill and relaxing! Great place Friendly staff, locally grown and produced products, craft beer and even personal hygiene products... What more can you ask for? Cute bar too! Nice little local hotspot inside East End Market just as you enter. The beautiful natural wood counter invites their customers in to their bar stool seating. The staff are welcoming and knowledgeable on their only local ingredients menu. To be honest, we only came for the drinks menu, but they do serve what looks to be delicious food.\\nMy other half ordered their very affordable beer flight, which included 5 beer samples for just $10! I on the other hand orders their Shrub which is a flavored vinegar with sparking wine or water. Let's just say he got the better end of the deal. Even though their options for beer are limited on draft, the options were tasty. As for me, I should've just stuck with me gut and gotten wine. The Bees Knees with sparkling water was boring. It tasted like just like water at first then a sour honey at the end. I gave it another try with their Mayhaw Berry option, which wasn't any better. To tart for my taste unfortunately.\\nNeedless to say I'm sure we will be back for their beer flight again and just avoid the Shrubs and order their food the next go around. Shout out to Florida & Co for repping the sunshine state HARD! From locally sourced ingredients, to brews from all over our lovely state- this spot is showcasing the flavors of all the fun under the Florida sun.\\n\\nDavid was awesome - and helped to prepare a great Beer Flight for me. From stouts to ciders, I got a chance to try 5 different beers. My two favorites were the Apple Cider from Keel and Curly as well as the Key Lime Beer from Key Billy. \\n\\nI also had a chance to try the Shrimp and Grits my momma ordered. This was as hearty as you'd expect a shrimp and grits to be, but not as decadent as your traditional southern preparation. \\n\\nMade with coconut oil instead of butter, the bowl of grits was topped with hearty portions of shrimp, greens, peppers and onions. It was so flavorful and almost too pretty to eat!\\n\\nThis spot has high top tables and a good amount of bar seating, but they'll also bring your food outside if you decide to dine al fresco.\\n\\nThey've also got a good selection of wines - even some wine on tap! They offer flights of wine as well which is fun. We discovered this little gem while waiting to  get into Domu. We took the server's suggestion, ordered a beer off their featured list and got the small plate Red Snapper Ceviche w/ plaintain chips (idk why it says chips, they were delicious, juicy and thick like normal fried plantains). I thought the ceviche was kind of sharp/acidic but my boyfriend loved it. Definitely recommend the ceviche on top of the plaintain to cancel out some of the acidity (even if it is a bit hard to scoop).\\n\\nCant wait to visit again! : ) A place you can buy local groceries and drink local beer and wine too?! What a unique concept!\\n\\nI haven't drank here yet, but I am very familiar with many of the brews they have on tap and sold as bottles. They are all high quality craft beers, all of which look to be brewed right here in Florida. One side of their grocery counter acts as a bar, where about 5 people can sit and enjoy their beer. You'll also see people sitting outside drinking too.\\n\\nSo far I have only bought a dozen eggs here, picked locally, for $4 a dozen. These are the same eggs you might have seen at the Audubon Park Farmers market. Browsing through their selection, they also have all local arugula, lettuces, heirloom tomatoes, squashes, and frozen meats. Plus spices and bottles of vanilla.\\n\\nI'm looking forward to having a cold local beer here one of these days. Went for the first time two days ago and was extremely impressed!  The pesto meatballs over zucchini \\\"pasta\\\" was fabulous as well as the ceviche, which was equally good.  It was great to be able to drink a grapefruit mimosa with fresh grapefruit pulp in it.  Yummy.  The decor and ambiance was steller!  I highly recommend. Great beer election, very helpful staff. They also have a variety of different products ranging from produce to beard cleanser to vanilla extracts. If you are in Orlando, you absolutely must visit the East End Market and stop by Local Roots. Love east end market overall as a whole but the service at Florida & Co beer was not good at all. We sat,  the guy working took several minutes just to greet us and when he did it wasn't friendly..as if we were a bother. There were only 2 other patrons and he engaged them 100% of the time, non-stop talking  about himself and his plans.  Very disappointing as I'm a local and visit this place often. One should engage, conversation with all customers,  be friendly to all. Thankfully there are other great local shops here with excellent customer service! Florida & Co. is the first place (on the left) when you walk in the front entrance at East End Market.  It used to be called Local Roots, but has been going through a branding change.  My husband and I ordered brunch from  Farm Haus (at the back left of East End) and then sauntered over to the bar at Florida & Co.\\n\\nWe were quickly greeted by two staff members that saw us eyeing their draft menu.  They provided recommendations based on the types of beers we like and my husband and I both ended up with drafts that we enjoyed.  The staff said that we could sit at their counter and eat/drink or we could wander around East End Market with our beers, no need to feel stuck there.  As we were waiting on our food to be ready, we took a seat at the bar there, and remained there eating once we got our food.\\n\\nThe offer locally sourced items such as meat, beer, body products, and honey.  Some of the items seemed a bit pricey to me, but others were what I expected at any market or grocery store.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and chatty with those the customers that were also chatty.  Overall, a great first beer at Florida & Co.  I'm sure we will continue to check out what they have on tap during our visits to the Market. This is an awesome place to find Florida local items. I love shopping small and shopping local, and this place kills two birds with one stone, as it were. They have everything from local craft beers to t-shirts that let you showcase your local love with a great shirt!\\n\\nI'll be headed back to snatch up the honey butter in the cold case. Couldn't take it on my last visit since I wasn't headed home, and it needs to be kept cool.\\n\\nThe staff greeted my sister and I right away and offered help on anything we wanted more info on. I also fell in love with the local roots t-shirt that had the Orlando city skyline on it. \\n\\nOverall: A\\nThis place rocks. I love local stuff and this place has it all! Amazing first experience. Ordered the Southern spicy with Florida white shrimp with a soft egg. Was extremely delicious, I was licking the bowl. Had the right balance of citrus and spice! What can I say it was delicious. Located at the front of the East End Market, Local Roots Farm Store offers a nice selection of items. Greens, veggies, farm fresh eggs, meats and nice locally made pantry items like Mannix Vanilla, grits and home and bath products. \\n\\nThe beautiful wood bar offers up a nice spot to enjoy Quantum Leap wines and Florida brewed craft beers. (Including Cask & Larder) Try a flight and sample your way through some great wines or craft brews. Local Roots offers wifi and a spot to sit down to enjoy your delicious sandwich from Hounds Tooth or maybe La Bretxa. Service is attentive and warm, if you prefer to soak up the beautiful Florida day, it's OK to take your glassware outside to the picnic tables or enjoy the courtyard. I love East End Market and Local Roots is one of the tenant merchants that help cement that love! This is the store that helps make EEM a market. I am able to stop by, pick up some bread, local meat, eggs, and a bottle of something fun!\\n\\nAs previous reviews have mentioned, LR has a fabulous wooden counter that you can sit at while sipping on local wine and beer (sometimes they even have rare brews!). I've also sat there having a coffee from Lineage when EEM was fairly empty and they had no problem with this. \\n\\nThey carry various seasonal greens, local organic meat & poultry, eggs ($4/dozen~ I can dig those prices!), locally-made greeting cards, lotions & elixirs, etc. I always get my eggs here now since they are so cheap and who can beat local, free-range eggs? No one. That's who.\\n\\nBut what always keeps me coming back is the service (isn't it  always that?). The person behind the counter is always incredibly nice and always seems genuinely interested in the customer. Last time I was there I bought some eggs, mentioned that they were for my sister's after-wedding brunch, and the woman gushed to my sister and wished her so much happiness and love. It was so nice and more than just a quick 'congrats.' \\n\\ntl;dr - Great eggs, great service = 5 stars Great selection of local and regional beers on tap and they have a sampler platter my favorite! The good service others rave about was absent during my recent weekend morning visit. A buddy and I sat down to eat food from the bakery across the hall - it was already 82 degrees at 11 a.m. and we didn't want to eat outside. \\n\\nThe Local Roots \\\"bartender\\\" said he only had beer and wine. No cold non-alcoholic drinks. He filled a pitcher with warm tap water (no ice), poured us each a glass and then put the pitcher out of reach. We downed the waters quickly - we'd been out biking - and started at our empty glasses while he spent five minutes counting coins in his coin box.\\n\\nNot wanting to be a pain I waited a while before getting up, walking over, and asking for a refill. He obliged - and then put the warm water pitcher out of reach again before walking off to adjust the twine holding the price tag to the kale basket at the back of the store. Same thing again, staring at empty glasses. There were 0-2 other customers in the store this whole time. \\n\\nI understand that we were not paying customers, but the bartender lost a chance to build goodwill and attract a future customer that would evangelize for a business that looks like it needs all the evangelism it can get. What would I have done in his shoes?\\n\\n- Poured the pitcher and then left it for us to \\\"self serve,\\\" freeing him to other duties\\n\\n- Gotten ice for the pitcher without putting the customer in the awkward position of being the 'I am only here drinking free water, and now you're asking me if you should walk across the building on my account for some ice' guy\\n\\n- Poured a couple little taster glasses of beer and slipped them in front of us unbidden. If we turn them down, the bartender just wasted 50 cents of product. If we drink them, he's got customers for life. (\\\"Hey! I'm that bartender's best friend! He just gave me a free beer!) Local Roots, you better clear out a permanent stool at your bar for me. I love your variety of all things Florida. From carrying local beers and wines to handmade hards and deli items. Aside from the eye catching wooden bar, the unique wooden taps truly draw a passerby's attention in. While we were a bit disappointed that we couldn't score a space at the bar to enjoy our Original Sin Pear Cider, we were more than happy to get some vitamin D with our brew at one of the outdoor picnic tables. \\n\\nI could reiterate all the positive things that the reviewers before me touched upon, but what stood out in my mind is the supremely chill vibe given off by the gents running the counter. They were helpful and very efficient despite every seat being taken at the bar. I loved the homemade feeling of everything, like I was welcomed at the counter in their personal kitchen. The chalkboard with the tap listing was a bit small, but it was effective in drawing us up to the counter to take a closer look. \\n\\nI hope I can time my next visit better, so I can pick the brains of the staff and learn more about their business. Those visiting EEM, make this a pitstop on your list whether you're buying a beverage or finding something deliciously local to take home with you. We fancied ourselves a beer while munching on our grilled cheese from La Femme du Fromage (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-femme-du-fromage-orlando?hrid=6G5cYcOnpwibl63Eib6mCA) and Local Roots was able to fill that need. With local beers on tap & the option to get a flight we were able to taste several beers from around the Sunshine State. \\n\\nLoved the wooden bar! Such a cool design. While we didn't purchase anything on this visit, I did love perusing the wares of the shop and thinking about what I might need to pick up next time. If I lived around the corner in the neighborhood, this would be the perfect place to stop to pick up something for dinner. \\n\\nThe gentleman behind the bar was super friendly and didn't rush us in any way even as the crowd started to pick up around lunch time. There's plenty of seating (~15 stools) at the bar so you shouldn't have too hard a time finding a place to sit. Absolutely love this cute and local vendor at East End Market! Florida & Co. serves local craft beers as well as wine and sparkling cocktails. I'm excited to try their food menu next. Apparently you get 25% off your tab when you eat dinner here, even alcohol. Do yourself a favor and try the shrubs. It sounds weird, but they are so good. They are more of an elixir that they mix with sparkling soda or champagne. I loved the hibiscus and Mayhan the best. And if you're looking to try a different wine or beer offered, go for the flights. They are a great deal. You can bring your drinks around the market or even go outside and listen to the live band that might be there. Or just sit at the bar and enjoy some friendly conversation with Emily and Perrin. One of my favorite dishes is shrimp & grits.  The dish as prepared  by Florida & Co offers a delicious healthier option to the traditional southern dish.  Not the less in flavor, it is prepared with coconut oil and adds Swiss chard and kale along with savory shrimp and an egg on top. The ingredients are locally sourced and are fresh   It is a dish worth repeating.  The setting is so nice. You can eat outside or inside at counter seating. They serve wine and also some craft beers on draft. I Can't wait for the next time I'm visiting the area to stop in at East end Market to try it again. Florida & Co is so good it will change your mind about Orlando. It proves it's more than a city just centered around touristy Disney World and full of gross, fried food. WRONG! \\n\\nFlorida & Co is a locally sourced restaurant inside the cool East End Market that prioritizes low sugar foods. On top of that, they sell some of Florida's best craft beer and ciders.\\n\\nI ordered the Mojo bowl or lunch with brown rice, kale, sweet peppers, orange slices, and Florida wild shrimp. It was all steamed and came with a light lime garlic sauce. It was so good, healthy, and balanced the flavors well (the orange slices were perfect and, yes, you are meant to eat the orange peel).\\n\\nThe drink list is really good and they always have a local cider on tap. I ordered the acai cider from Accomplice Brewery and it was one of the best drinks I've ever had.\\n\\nOn top of that, the space is beautiful with a few tables off to the side and a long wood bar to sit at. Also, the service is excellent and friendly! Claim to be a small craft brewery specialist, doesn't even know the difference between white IPA and a pale ale... food is pretty good but owner is incompetent, decent experience but made it hard to enjoy a beer due to bad attitude. Stick too food here This place is a wonderful staple in the East end market. The last few times I've been here have been as a layover type visit- while waiting on a table at Domu or just for cheese (from the fromage) and beer but I need to change that as their menu has expanded and looks rather tasty AND healthy. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the local craft beers they have and are always willing to let you sample something before you decide. The bar front seating can be limited but they are more than willing to let you sit outside with drinks and will deliver food to you outside as well. I came here a few weekends ago with friends and it was so amazing! It's located inside East End Market so a great place to hangout on a Saturday or Sunday morning. They have ample seating space, extremely friendly employees, and a menu full of feel-good, delicious meals and snacks. I ordered the Florida Bowl with Shrimp. It did take a few minutes to prepare, but I was the first customer of the morning and they prepared everything fresh which was nice. The bowl began with a bed of rice, a hearty portion of greens, ample pickled vegetables, and a deliciously light cilantro-lemongrass sauce. Four or five large shrimp adorned the top of the bowl. \\n\\nI absolutely loved this! First of all, it was piping hot and extra comforting on a rainy morning. At $15 a bowl, you really get a perfect sized portion-- enough to feel like you've got your money's worth, but not simply loaded with cheap fillers. The cilantro-lemongrass sauce was truly a standout. A lot of times I order things with sauce on the side because they're too often heavy handed in the application, or way too oily. There was just the right amount of sauce added to this bowl and it wasn't loaded down with weird oils. Absolutely wonderful-- highly recommend! I was really excited to come to this place to try some ceviche. I'm not sure if it was the advertising , but it looks delicious. Surely enough it was. However their is always more then one aspect to a dining experience! Let's take it from the top! \\n\\nI'd like to start with the parking. Which you have to acknowledge as lackluster. It is understandable, for a market that shares space with several different kinds of businesses. However, space is available right outside of East End as it does tend to fill up quickly and for many hours on end. All within a short walking distance and free. No worries! \\n\\nFlorida and Co is located right up front on your left as soon as you enter. The aesthetic immediately captures your attention and if seafood is your thing, then it will also captures your tastebuds. Upon seating ourselves and reviewing the menus. We ordered 2 waters which were filled a quarter full each time (including the one refill). I'm not sure if that is part of the experience or not. No big deal, I finally settled upon ordering the ceviche bowl and anxiously awaited as I contained my growling stomach! \\n\\nMy favorite time arrived as I received my food within minutes and was extremely excited to eat this meal. I went with the jasmine rice option as well and really hoped for a nice heaping bowl of ceviche for $15. To my dismay, I received the bowl, minus the heaping. It turned out to be enough food for about half the actual size of the bowl. In all fairness, the food was absolutely delicious. The fish was very fresh and the acidity and lime really work well together in the ceviche. The onions are proportionate and the jasmine rice is to die for. \\n\\nA restaurant is much more than a food establishment though, it is at its heart. A service based business. I would like to mention Kristen as a very nice and helpful employee. I say this because Kristen turned out to be the only one their that morning who actually put on a nice friendly smile and sought to uphold the customer service standard. Aside from that, I must note that the service in general was bad. After paying for my purchase and putting the tablet on the table for my girlfriend to pay for her meal, the  employee across from us snatched the tablet and gives it to a couple next to me, forcing us to awkwardly wait for someone to check out before us in the middle of us checking out. That was really uncomfortable for me. I still left a tip because I appreciate the hard work small business go through and just want to show my support in anyway possible. \\n\\n\\nOverall, the food is good here. I don't warn anyone against going here. If ceviche or seafood is your thing, you might want to go for it. As for me, Unfortunately, I will not be back, but I do have high hopes for the future of this business! Their food is just amazing. Have you ever had the first bite of something and literally say \\\"OH MY GOD\\\" this is so good and just be in  over it? Lol yeah this places does that to me every time. Everyone who works there is also super nice and helpful. Love love love. If you haven't tried it you MUST! Every time I hit up East End, I always go to Gideon's and Domu. But this time I finally gave the other spots a try, which led me to the zucchini noodle bowl at Florida & Co. they're clearly capitalizing on the fad diets of New Years Resolutions, which is fine by me! The zucchini was crunchy and it soaked up that great pecan pesto sauce. Topped it with their homemade meatballs and red sauce, and I was in heaven. The bowl packed flavor and savor and it satisfied my pasta needs. We came here for another establishment but on our way out of this indoor farmers market type place we made a pit stop. My husband tried a sample of the Central 28, Upriver American Pale Ale 6%. He enjoyed it so much he went ahead and got a glass for $7.00. \\n\\nI will say their beer pairs well with Gideons cookies. 5 Stars for all of the reasons mentioned in my prior review and now some fabulous prepared food!\\n\\nThere's still the local beers, locally made products, and tasty wines, but what was once Local Roots is now Florida & Co., and it provides another great option for prepared food at East End Market.\\n\\nI took a seat at one of their round high top tables and ordered the (local meat) meatball sandwich and a rice bowl of pickled veggies, lettuce, and shrimp. Of course, I forgot to take a picture of the menu, so I don't have the official names of these dishes, but it seems like anything you order off this menu is going to be quality and full of flavor.\\n\\nThe meatball sandwich was hearty and had enough acidity to leave you feeling light afterwards. Which is the first time I can remember feeling that after a meatball sub. The rice bowl had thinly sliced pickled cucumbers, carrots, and beautiful lettuce leaves (I want to say butter lettuce, but I'm not great at identifying greens...). But the star of the dish was the shrimp. There were plenty of perfectly seasoned shrimp (no poop vein!) and a bite of pickled vegetables with shrimp is flavor perfection!\\n\\nService was great (thanks, David!) and the round tables gave more privacy for lunch meetings than when you used to only have the bar as an option. There's not as much selection in terms of produce or local gifts, but that's been replaced with really, really good food. So, overall, a great change!\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1075,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Cleaned Review\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The sandwich was made well and delivery was fast.  Cannot comment on customer service since I just ordered online for delivery.  I would order again if I am working in the area again. This Jimmy Johns is the worst that I have been to and I frequent them a lot. The staff are not friendly and the subs are very thin, not worth the money. Food tastes as expected (what you want from a chain). Took close to forty minutes and I was a mile away - not freaky fast. The beach club is my favorite! Awful! I ordered my food at 11:05 and did not receive it until 1:40. Customer service was awful. The service here was horrible.  Staff is very unfriendly!  I had to tell the girl 3 times before she got my order correct and then she acted like it was my fault.  I will not be coming back.  The jalape\\u00f1o chips are good but their tuna tasted like it died a slow painful death. \\\"Freaky Slow\\\" should be this locations motto. I ordered online and 15 minutes before arriving to the store and when I got here I had to wait another 15. Very poorly managed store, absolutely ridiculous, they even have a huge staff on hand. Ok let us start by say the loud music as if I am walking into a night club. Then I look at the menu before I get to the cash register and I stand the for a minute before I say something to the guy that is standing there and refuse to face me to take my order WTH. Then he whispers do you want cheese on that and I said yes, come to find out I was charged extra for the cheese. WHAT IS A SANDWICH WITHOUT DARN CHEESE SMH I AM DONE WITH PLACE. Now for the group of employees that make the place look like a hang out spot I AM DONE DROPPING THE MIC My wife and I are here with out 2 yr old son.  We each ordered a sandwich and began to eat, feeding our son from our own sandwich.  We quickly realised he was only interested in the bread so went up to grab a day old bread for 50 cents. The kind gentlemen behind the counter asked if it was for the little guy and gave it to him for free, asking if we needed any sauces on it for him.  Give the place a shot; what a kind, selfless thing to do! Nice refreshing change of pace from the old fast food burger joints. My wife and I order from here regularly. The app works great for us and the delivery is always really fast.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are always correctly put together and the quality is great. You definitely get what you pay for. \\n\\nAs a suggestion, I always ask them to \\\"take some bread out\\\" when ordering the French bread, it helps to eat the sandwhich without losing the goods. What I do not understand how people manage to hire employees with bad attitudes and let them be the face of a business.3 employees working with no smile, no greeting and bad attitude like someone killed their cat. \\nWalked up to the counter and I get greeted with \\\"whatchu want\\\". Ordered a sub an Asked for a cup of water, got a dreadful reply \\\"we are out of water cups\\\" with absolutely no sense of remorse, let alone a \\\"sorry\\\". It is like I am not giving them business, they are doing me a favor by serving me.\\nIf you hate your jobs so much, do not spoil your customer's mood with bad attitude. Go find another job or leave your f-ing attitude at home. I ordered 2 sandwiches to be delivered. 45 mins later? I am still waiting. Apparently the B Team is working because it would have absolutely faster to drive there myself, eat, and drive back. If you order delivery...really any time of the day... expect a call telling you they either \\\"do not have bread\\\" or they will tell you they do not have a delivery driver. Freaky fast delivery? More like freakishly unpredictable and incredibly unreliable/nonexistent delivery. Absolutely obnoxious. Food is always fresh and good, however the service is terrible.  They never get the order right and the employees are rude and not helpful.  The GM is terrible.  AVOID Terrible customer service including the manager. Had a driver yell for not getting a tip, do better the food is still great I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but this jimmy johns not only got our order wrong twice when we were in the store, we realized after we had left that they had forgotten to put meat on two of the sandwiches. The sandwich also left my stomach very unsettled making me think I got a touch of food poisoning too. This jimmy johns needs some serious improvement. I have been here several times, and every time the service has not met Jimmy Johns status. My last visit is what pushed me to write this review and to not return.\\n\\n1. The lady making my sandwich was bossy and yelling at her kids while she was making my sandwich.\\n\\n2. They locked all the doors when they closed in an hour and a half. When I was unlocking the door to leave, the same lady demandingly yelled and told me not to unlock the door. How do you except me to leave? I ignored her and opened it anyway.\\n\\n3. Same lady lied to me. When she handed me my sandwich she said the bread was hard because it just came out of the oven. But it was not hot. I am a professional baker, bread is hard because you burned it or its stale. I was not going to complain but do not lie to me. The bread was not enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n4. They are slow compared to most Jimmy Johns.\\n\\n\\nDo not yell at me do not lie to me and send your kids home. I am used to getting fast, friendly service at Jimmy John's. This place was neither of those things. I was the only customer there, so it is not like they were too busy. The lady who was making my sandwich started to make it, and then stopped so she could finish her conversation with I coworker. The sandwich was not put together very well. I do not expect to visit this location again. Just like the commercials say, this place is FAST.  By the time I paid and finished putting my change in my wallet they were handing me a sandwich.  I thought they were accidentally handing me someone else's... LOL\\nOn my most recent visit, I ordered The Vito.  It was noticeably fresh with decent flavor, but it could have used a little more meat and liquid (oil, vinegar, mustard, mayo). \\nIf you are pressed for time though as I was on this day, this is your perfect lunch spot. First off customer service definitely lacked. Walking in it looked like they were closed. Crew members were sitting and leaning on tables and loud music was playing. The girl that took my order was slightly rude (making a comment to a sauce I wanted on my sandwich). When wrapping up my order, the same girl that took my order reaches into the pickle jar and takes a pickle with her BARE HANDS. Ew never will I ever come back to this establishment. No one wants to spend money at a place where the employees clearly do not care. This use to be my favorite Jimmy Johns location but the quality of workers has really brought the service down.  My last visit during my transaction the cashier (named Marie ) never spoke or looked at  me once..  I am not kidding.  I walked in she stood next the register so i started giving my order, she put her hand out for my credit card and gave me a receipt.  I have to find a new favorite location. Walked in the other day. Ordered a sandwich to go. The gentlemen who helped me were very nice and accommodating. It was my first time ever being at a JJ's and they were patient and answered all my questions Sandwich was made fresh. Since I was not eating the sandwich right away, I was worried about it getting soggy. Not the case. I ate half and ended saving the other half for even later and it was still fresh! Even though I did not eat it there, still a clean establishment. I called for a delivery order at 4 pm.  The lady taking my order was more interested in talking to someone else about going on breaks.  She was VERY RUDE to me (as a paying customer) and acting like I was interrupting her.  WTF Jimmy Johns.  I know you are better than this. \\n\\nSOO.... 30 minutes later (when my order should have been delivered) the same rude woman calls me back to let me know their delivery driver will not be in for work until 5 pm.  WHY WAS NOT I TOLD THIS WHEN I ORDERED????  She offers no apology or any explanation.  She advises me that I can wait until their driver shows up for work OR I can come pick it up myself.  I cancelled the order. This location will not have my business any longer. \\n\\nThis Jimmy John's is terrible and DOES NOT live up to their company standards.  It is pathetic. Customer service at this location is the worst i have ever expirienced.  \\n\\nI called in an order. I may have as well gone through  a drive through.  You know what happens there.  You get F#@#@ed. \\n\\n I   asked if my special request had been fulfilled and was told  yes.  Upon return to work i found that the request was honored but my order was worng.  \\n\\nWhen i called to complain is when the horrible service began.  That store is run by incompetent extremely rude people.\\nI was  told that there  was no way to speak with the owner of this franchise location.  No response from a call i have in to him either.   I guess the poor service is from top to bottom.   Will never go there again. I did not get his name, but the guy with dreads fixed my sandwich. His sandwich counter was filthy and he did not follow any directions on light mayo, light mustard etc. Super fast but that because they barely made the sandwich. Turkey sandwich what could go wrong... let me tell you. \\nI had to search for the lettuce due to such a small amount even a friend asked if I ordered no lettuce. There was more mayo than turkey, I guess 1 slice of turkey is the spec because the whole office enjoyed their bread and mayo experience.  But it was fast.  Increase your quality and not just speed. I called in my order and when I got there girl was cleaning down and never made my food. Took off cleaning glove picked up new glove and made my tuna sandwich. But she was stoned and store smelled like trees, they had the door open. I walked into pot lounge. Never going back Horrible customer service and unprofessional delivery driver. Why would you call a customer to complain about an accidental tip online. You never know what someone has waiting on you IN CASH! Oh and they hang up on you too. Never give this location business. Hopefully they all lose their jobs in the next few months. I think Jimmy John's has a pretty good product. The meat is pretty fresh, as well as the lettuce. Their bread is pretty tasty too. You can expect to pay $7 and change for a sandwich or $11 and change for a combo. If their prices were a tad bit cheaper I would say it is worth five stars. All in all it is a convenient, healthy option for lunch! Worst seen to date!! Ordered online and the app showed that it was made and out for delivery within 20 min... well, after an hour I called and they said they had to bake the bread and it was cooling and that they would make it in about 10 min. It was finally delivered 1 hr and 40 min after it was ordered. Almost TWO hours for a sandwich!!! WOW... This is the absolute worst Jimmy John's I have ever been to.  They are very slow, customer service is terrible, they cannot make a sandwich like you ordered if their life depended on it.  They argue with you if you call them out on their error and insist you are wrong...  Um.... I am the customer, remember?  I used to go here every week, but I do not think I will be back unless there is a real turnover in employees.  It is a real shame too. Went to Jimmy Johns after work because nothing else was open for vegans around that area. This was around 9:20p. I got the veggie club. They started making the sandwich and said they were out of tomato. I said \\\"you do not have any at all?\\\". She was like yea but they are in the back and I would have to cut it. (With a attitude) She then looked at the time like I was wasted her time to close and clean up. This staff has always been over it and looked like they do not want to work there. Not surprising really. Giving two stars because she actually cut the tomato for me, attitude and all.\",\n          \"Food was adequate for what it was. My boyfriend ordered a Mojito, they had no mint, said nothing and instead ended up with what tasted like crystal light, vodka and too much lime juice....not terribly interested in returning. This is a dive that I used to go to, but do not anymore because of a proximity factor. As I said it is just a dive to meet and chat, have a drink with friends, and so expectations not being to high, it never really disappoints. Service is kind of lacking sometimes. I was happy with the Nachos. Wish there was more cheese on it. But the guacamole was top notch!\\n\\nHeads UP: They have a 50 cent charge for take out. Cheap drinks, lots of room, realy friendly bar tender, cheap pool, and lots of fun alcoholics. so cute. really close to the max and a great haven to escape from the crazies on skidmore. WTF.... Had to pay for food before even ordered ...Hmmm ever been to burger king if so EAT ThERE service is better and the food with out  a thought 10000 times better.\\nAs for service stay away from the bartender Joe just a wipe we brought my partner's parents here and had the veggie s/m burger with salad. my partner had the eggs benedict, and they shared the french dip with fries. everything was delicious, and the server was so friendly and efficient. love the atmosphere. Went in for lunch during the week and sat in a booth far away from the bar.  I think all the action was at the bar because we never got any service.  When we first sat down someone asked us what we would like and we said we needed a minute. Then no one ever came back.  After a while we just got up and left and ate some place near by because being ignored made us feel awkward and I did not want to go ask for service and seem rude.  I am just too passive to eat here. This is my fav lunch and dinner spot. The service is too notch and the food is excellent. There is a new owner who is committed to the bar and her employees. I really appreciate her commitment as a regular. They have switched up the menu and introduced craft cocktails! I recommend coming down to this spot for lunch, dinner or happy hour. I hear the brunch is spot on also I am excited for Pride! The place will be packed! I had no idea this bar was over here. In this side of town you just get used to your usual places unless you live downtown, work there or spend way too much time in bars...no offense...everyone needs hobbies right. I love the decor which seemed pretty butch and no dive bar at all - I was confused as to the reviews mentioning it as a dive since that was not the impression I got at all though I hear they went through a remodel. The staff were amazing and when we went there with a Barfly bus filled with 40 they slammed our drink orders out smoking fast. The drinks were well priced and well made too. Nothing screamed gay bar at all and there was a birthday party happening with catering and everything which was neat - that they can section off parts like that. My boyfriend and I frequent this bar, but not just for the drinks.  We are both big fans of the food.  Attention is paid to the quality of the meals you get and the prices are reasonably low for the the amount they serve you.  The service tends to be kind of spotty, a bit of a hit or miss sort of thing, but there are a few waiters/bartenders that make it all the more worth it to stop in.  It is conveniently located just off the max line and is very easy to find if you know what you are looking for, though we found that we had actually walked by the place several times without even being aware of it is existence.  It is relatively conservative inside on the decor, and not nearly as in-your-face as something like The Eagle, but you still sense a presence of acceptance and tolerance.  It is not uncommon to see men dressed as women at the bar ordering a drink and talking to the bartenders as old friends.  It is a welcoming environment.\\nMy only suggestion for the place would be to hire on a new waiter or two.  There have been several times my boyfriend and I have gone in and had to wait an unusually long time to have our orders taken, or to get our check.  We do not mind too much, especially considering there is typically 1-2 people working as bartenders and doubling as waiters.  It is not there fault, I just hope that management notices that many of their customers are not as tolerant to their short-staffed nature as my boyfriend and I are.  \\nAll in all, this place is a good time with great food.  Check it out when you are not in a hurry and ask about the specials-some of them are REALLY great deals.  Cheers! Absolutely HORRIBLE service!!!! Refused to give us water unless we bought alcohol first! Completely outrageous behavior from the bartender, will never go there again. Have never been treated so horribly I have been to Fox & Hounds a handful of times now, and each time it is the same bartender. That is comforting. It is a nice, \\\"old man bar\\\" - but, there are not a lot of old men here, generally speaking. For a nice, quiet gay bar, I highly suggest this place. If C.C. Slaughters is too loud for you to talk, pop on in to Fox & Hounds and have a few drinks. \\n\\nThey have a pretty extensive menu, as well - including your old standby's of fried bar food. The French Dip is simple but quite good. The Jalapeno Poppers are a favorite. The Chicken Strips and Fries are quite sufficient and tasty. \\n\\nOne pool table, lots of seating, friendly establishment. The location to the dance club of Slaughters night life is perfect. I would definitely try stopping in and not let previous reviews strip you of the opportunity to support this local establishment. A couple weeks ago, my friend and I went to Fox & Hounds for the Ladies of Rock drag show fundraiser for various charities. We got there super early and the servers were very attentive. My friend and I had just eaten dinner somewhere else and were not really looking to order anything food/ drink wise, so we tried to stay under the radar with the ordering. Eventually the place filled up and we did not have to keep saying we were waiting for friends to order. Anyway, I would definitely come here again for another drag show. I am glad I did not drink because the unisex bathrooms were kind of gross (why cannot boys pee IN the toilet?) and I did not want to have to go again. That is my only real criticism... I would not waste your time or money at The Fox & Hounds.  I went there with a friend the other night to grab some food and a beer.  The restaurant from the street looked inviting and the atmosphere pleasant.  We sat ourselves, per instruction from the sign in the entrance, and waited for our server.  We waited and waited and waited.  20 minutes later our server, real short hair and balding, pale in complection and rocking 2 tattooed arm sleeves, came over to us and apologized for the wait saying he did not see us.  I was not sure how that could be as we were sitting in direct line of sight.  No problem, I will take his word for it and let it go.  We got our menus and ordered beers right away.  20 minute wait made us thirsty.  Our server proceeded to take a beverage order for a table of 8 next to us.  Then he shot back up to the bar and began doing I do not know what.  At one point he removed his shirt to expose his white tank-top undershirt.  A little classless but whatever- I am not judging.  10 minutes later the server came over with drinks in his hands for the table of 8.  That was the last straw for me and we got up and left.  Upon exiting the server asked us \\\"oh, are you guys leaving?\\\" Either he had no clue of his poor customer service on display or he just did not really want to serve us.  Whatever way you look at it, it was poor poor service.  I wish I could comment on the food but we did not get that far.  Portland has many, many food options and The F&H is not worth your time! It is not a busy Saturday afternoon but, a lot of dirty tables. Every ketchup bottle was almost empty it took three to get enough for my fries. Plus the bottles were all dirty. Napkins were non existent. No line at the bar but, I had to wait over five minuets to get a Coke while the bartender chatted with his friend. \\nBartender was super nice & food is improved over the old management but, some serious side work etc needs to be taken into consideration. One bus tub and about five minuets would have had the dining room looking neat. I hit Fox's regularly. It is like \\\"Cheers\\\" for the Portland gay crowd.  Food is reasonable and good, drinks are strong, and the atmosphere is warm, inviting, friendly.  Friday happy hour is great. The ambience is Cheers-esque, which happened to be playing on the tv above the bar when I was there for lunch recently. It is neighborhoody. There are regulars. The bartender learns your name. The service is very good--the bartender who is also the waiter during the day is warm without being over the top. He is sincere, low-key, and consistent.\\nThe food is actually pretty good. Some things shine--like their daily soups. The beer and cheese soup that I had was one of the best beer and cheese soups I have ever had. And their grilled cheese is just like mom used to make. On the surface, it is a three star joint. But something about it keeps inviting me back. So I will throw it another star for that ineffable 'come back' quality. Been to this restaurant before, food and atmosphere were not anything special. Now, on their menu, they are blaming increased prices on new minimum wage laws. I will not in any way support a restaurant that takes worker protections out on their own employees. I feel bad for those people. Your employer is clearly terrible and you should probably seek new employment. Shame on you, Fox and Hounds. I will never return to your establishment and will encourage my friends, family and colleagues to do the same. If you have a problem with local laws, take it out on your legislators, not on your workers and the community. That was nice bar... Good taste ... Meeting friend and drink and eat .. Kind of relaxing place to go there ... The bartender is surprisingly rude & slow despite there being 9 people here not ordering, just listening to shitty 80's music and being old/bitter. \\n10ish minutes after ordering, they told us they did not have the ingredients for what we ordered, and were uppity when we asked to see the menu again. They messed up my order, and what I got was an over-priced, dried out travesty. And everyone 45+ and/or bitter lesbian/gay got better service than us (young gays), point of order: came in after us, got food before us. That autistic guy is not lying! And their fugly regulars decided to chime in when my friend had a \\\"difficult\\\" vegetarian order (#SorryNotSorry it is 2015 and you live in Portland). Not coming back. Good food, inexpensive drinks.  The dinner special on Friday was Prime Rib for $12.50!  How could you pass that up?\\n\\nI rarely had to wait at the bar for service, the bartender was friendly. Until last night, I had only been to Fox and Hounds once with a friend for a quick stroll through and once during Pride Week when everyone was drunk and acting crazy. \\nLast night, a friend and I went for happy hour and dinner.  This area of town seems to be really calm and slow until later at night, which is cool, if you just want a relaxed time.  There were maybe two other people when we arrived around 4:30 and then maybe four tables of people when we left.  \\nThe drinks were good and strong.  I had  crispy chicken salad, which was really good.  The chicken was not heavily battered and the salad had lots of different veggies.  I forgot to ask for no cheese as I am trying to avoid dairy and they do not put any on it anyway, so I was happy.  My friend's club sandwich looked really good and he said it was. Prices were very reasonable. \\nThe bartender was low key, not super friendly but mellow.  I would definitely recommend Fox and Hounds if you just want a mellow drink or meal, I have no idea what the later crowd is like. Well, the decor was beautiful, the food fantastic.  The bar staff was about as friendly and courteous as a plague infected rat.  Go there for the ambiance and the food, but do not except the welcoming committee...it does not exist there Small kitchen means you might be waiting for 4 tacos for 50 minutes on a Tuesday... that is with the bar at half capacity. I know there is a new owner and I think she would be best served by simplifying the menu. It is better to do a few things really well, than to do a lot of things slightly better than poorly. It is the only bar open for lunch in the area, they have a real opportunity to be a draw. I will keep my fingers crossed. Worst experience ever. Just got into town & was looking for a quick meal & drink before a show downtown. This place liked decent and had customers inside, so I entered...I was going to wet myself as I was finishing my coffee I would been drinking during the trip so I immediately went into the restroom before making my way toward the bar (a sign in the entryway said \\\"Please seat yourself\\\" and there was no greeter). As I did a gentleman approached & said \\\"Hey man when you came in here you broke about 3 of my rules. You did not talk to any of us, you had a backpack on, and you have a drink in your hand. Now get your ass out the door now!\\\" I tried explaining that I would never been there so did not know about \\\"his rules\\\", nor did I think I had to speak to anyone since the sign said seat yourself. However, anytime I tried to speak he just yelled \\\"Out the door\\\" over & over, louder & louder. Needless to say, I will not be coming here again & neither should you! Rude gay bar. I am straight and do not mind patronizing any business.  They have a beautiful bar and nice happy hour. The bartender, however, made me feel unwelcome. He was talking to other gay customers about an orgy he attended the night before. I really did not care but decided to leave for a quieter place. After tipping him I turned to leave and he called me breeder.\\n\\nThe food menu is good. Yes, strong drinks, but do I have to deal with a rude waiter? This place should not discriminate against anyone, but I guess my Aspergers is not accepted here. I asked a couple simple questions and received rude responses and then I was targeted to receive my food last and only after I asked where my food was. Then I did not get my bill when I asked. I will not be back if he is around. Fox and the Hounds has the honor of being my first 1 star review . If you have not been through the gauntlet to be a regular, or are not a rude mouthy lesbian, over the age of 40, or a desperate gay alcoholic, no reason to come here, unless you are craving bowling ally food, without the bowling ally. \\nDefinitely NOT a place everyone in the gay community can feel welcome, as a gay 20 something, I was absolutely appalled by the customer service. \\nI am a hairstylist, so patron interactions are the single most important thing for me when it comes to my dining experience, and this was the worst I have ever had. I killed him with kindness to find the bartender had a headache, and was stressed from calling the cops on a drunk/over served 90 y/o regular.\\n I would give the place 2 stars because he was not feeling so great, but I have never been treated so horribly! And then another regular, a large butch women mocked me for my \\\"complicated\\\" order ( a veggie burger with no cheese or mayonnaise) I knew she was a regular because she asked about the bartenders recent vacation. \\nIt is almost laughable! How is this place still in business?! I live on the NW park blocks, and have been looking for a relaxed place to come to that was not the atmosphere of C.C's. Unfortunately, the search continues, and I will make sure to let my friends and clients know where to NOT go for a good time. Wow! What has happened to Fox and Hound? I just went there for dinner, and it was horrible. First the blonde bimbo bartender was too busy talking to the three people that were at the bar but finally I ordered a drink. Told her I would be at the table and I want to dinner. Literally the cook had to tell her that I was ready to order. I waited and waited for my salad which I asked for no onions. Finally the cook brought out my dinner and I had to tell him what about my salad. I got my salad covered in onions after my dinner was brought out. Got the chicken fried steak dinner it was so salty I could not even finish it. Then I had to go up to the bar to get my bill because she never came back over to the table. And she actually asked me \\\"oh did you have to drinks?\\\" Fox and Hound a hard no. Is this place even a gay establishment anymore? Apparently there is a new owner. She needs to work on customer service and the menu and hiring the right people. I give Fox & Hounds 4 out of 5 stars mainly because of the staff, who are very friendly and accepting of everyone. They make newcomers feel like regulars. \\n\\nIt is primarily a gay bar, but you could bring business clients there for lunch and never know it was a gay bar. Tasteful, conservative decor. Lots of straight people enjoy it as well. A good place to bring mixed sexuality groups, without making anyone feel uncomfortable. \\n\\nIf rated for their food, the score would be one star lower, I am afraid. They rely too much on frozen, fried food. That having been said, though, their food is better than most bar food, and sometimes they really hit a home style daily special out of the park. And, their hamburgers are very reliable. Not quite gourmet burgers, but better than your average bar fare.\\n\\nThey have a Sunday brunch that is quite good if you arrive early and the food is still fresh. A friend and I stopped at this place today, Sat, Apr 26, '14, at about 3 pm.\\n\\nFood was ok, not great.  Drinks were a bit weak.\\n\\nBut the bartender (slender, about 48-49, short hair) was RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!!  No wonder there were only 3 other people there. came in here to escape the rain. drinks were strong and the bartender was great - good service and friendly. my boyfriend most definitely attracts the gay male population in portland as he got chatted up on the street numerous times, it is almost like we were attracted to this bar by divine intervention ;) I literally could not believe it..... Saturday of Portland Pride weekend, the place was packed, and the management had allotted ONE front of the house employee- the bartender!! \\n\\nI will never go back, because of their extremely poor showing on Pride. A gay bar? There is plenty better queer dives in this town. Horrible SERVICE! & Rude.... not personable at all... was frowned at and glared at while ordered food & i brought family in to eat and have a cocktail.. Gurllll.. shameful.. I am very very disappointed in this place! It is in a great location near CC Slaughters so you would think this place would have more business. This place could be great. Sadly the service suck! Specially the old bitch cranky bartender!  What is up with his diva attitude! He is chasing away customers and thanks to him business is going down for them! I would hope the owner would realize this place could be great with out crappy service! Just remember have a bad experience ill tell 10 people, have a great experience I will come back and bring people in! Your move! So my friend and I needed to use a bathroom bad! We popped in here and she went in while I waited my turn, the bartender came over and said \\\"we have 2 more bathrooms in back. He was so friendly we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink. I do not mind that the place was mostly a gay bar, even though we were obviously not. He was really nice and welcoming. I will definitely recommend The Fox and Hounds. Cute place and super chill. love it.  It is your total comfort food place if you ever need one.  It is a great queer place to hang out at as well.  Drinks are made strong, which is good!\\n\\nThe staff was great and the prices were pretty reasonable for the amount of food that you get!  Plus they are open super super late! A very low-key gay bar. Perfect environment for the gay community, but without the extremes. Good food, fair prices. I work right across the street from Fox & Hounds.  During the summer months when I go outside to eat my lunch I always see people from the company I work for go and eat at this establishment.  I often wondered why so many people went over there.  Is it a convenience factor?  Is the food really that good?  What gives?  Well, after all these years of working in this neighborhood I decided it was time to see what the deal was.  I took a colleague of mine out for lunch here and another gem was found.\\n\\nFirst off the food here is very affordable.  Most of their sandwiches are under $8.  This is not an $8 sandwich that you get at some of the sandwich shops in town that come with nothing and you laugh at how small it is.  This is a good sized sandwich that comes with a side (salad, fries, cup of soup?).  My colleague had heard that the Chicken Cordon Bleu ($7.25) sandwich was really good here.  That is what we both ended up ordering.  That and a few drinks (of the non-alcoholic variety as it was a work day) got me out the door for only $21.\\n\\nThe sandwich was very tasty.  The chicken was nice and moist and the bun that came along for the ride lasted throughout that ride.  I wanted to be a good boy and get a salad and was quite happy that it was pretty big.  Very good bang for your buck.\\n\\nFox & Hounds is also a bar that I believe caters mostly to the gay crowd.  Not that you have to be gay to come here.  I imagine it gets pretty lively here at nights and on weekends.  I know it as a place to get a sandwich or a burger that will not break the bank.  Now I know and knowing is half the battle. At first I thought this place looked like a spin off a rustic saloon, but then I realized it was just old and dirty. I have been here a couple times and (I hate to say it) ordered the same thing. Each time it looked completely different. Zero consistency. The bartenders are nice, but they go out for smoke breaks often and one of them had a \\\"shift drink\\\" (or shot, more like) during his shift. I see the potential, but definitely needs work. Good atmosphere and good priced drinks. Solid cheeseburger and french dip. My wife and I did not even realize it was a gay bar until halfway through our meal. I would go back for another french dip. It was late on a Friday night.  We were looking for a quiet place for an after-the-show get-together.  One of our friends highly recommended Fox & Hounds, stating something about the bartender always excited to them, so we took the small stroll over.\\nFrom the outside, it looked like the ambiance we were looking for.  Relaxed, pool tables in the corner for casual games, and a bat half filled with patrons.  The transition inside was not what I was expecting, which was the loud music which made things really difficult for me.  Everyone else seemed to be able to communicate just fine over the blaringly obviously iTunes playlist on shuffle that played on the speaker system; for me though, I just gave up taking part of any conversation and just wish the night would end and go home. Used to like this place. New owners, new name. The rainbow flag is gone. Using the restroom requires asking for a key attached to a ridiculously large tchatchke. The tchatchke was disgustingly filthy. Like using the restroom at a Texaco. I ordered the fish and chips. The menu said ling cod. I got frozen Atlantic cod. Major difference. The coleslaw was old enough to vote, it was rotten and translucent. My husband got the Cordon Bleu. He still smells like onions. ONIONS! The fries were ok, large steak fries but the ketchup was obviously married and I did not want to play shigellosis roulette. A sports themed bar with shitty food is really the last thing Old town/Chinatown needs at this point. Especially one that ignores the neighborhood demographics. Good luck Second Ave Sports Bar, you are going to need it. Giving this place 5 stars because there is a new owner that is working hard to make things better. It is worth coming down again to check out since I think most people have forgotten about this place. Menu has been slimmed down to a more manageable selection. Food service at this time is still a little slow to get out orders. This is a bit of a problem during the weekday lunch hour since most people downtown are on a schedule and need to get in and out and back to work.  I think after a few of the kinks and growing pains are worked out this will be a downtown hangout worth coming back to. Came in yesterday for a quick drink before catching the train to the airport. Quiet, local gay bar. I encountered a nice bartender who pointed me in the right direction to the train stop, so I am kind of surprised by the negative Yelp reviews as I did not experience anything remotely like what I have read. Very fun, good food, casual, just up the street from more touristy places. Friendly crowd and staff. Beautifully remodeled, nice and dimly lit with a warm and cozy atmosphere complemented with friendly and attitudeless service.   I find this place great for relaxing with a beer and a shot after work.  Far cry from yesteryear when the establishment was frequented by loud over weight, unattractive, tweakers/drunks with personalities equal to that of underwatered houseplants.  Good moderately priced menu.  I would frequent this place more often if the pool table was less than seventy-five cents per game......or even  free!! Ate here before and enjoyed it, returned recently and I got to say putting a sticker on your menu saying \\\"due to mimimum wage increases everything on the menu is +$1\\\" is also saying \\\"I would literally pay my workers less than this if the government would let me\\\" or \\\"I do not care about my employees, so they will not care about the quality of your food.\\\" \\nNever coming back and advising other to not eat here! This is a quiet, relaxing place.  I like that!  If you are looking for loud music and a raucous atmosphere, this is not the place for you.  But it is a very pleasant place with reasonable prices on food and drink.  Just one word of advice..  if you order steak or prime rib, ask for it to be cooked rare.  They seem to overcook the beef here until it is dry and tasteless. I have had really bad experience here.. But I am updating my review based on my experience with a bartender named Matt... Really awsome... Visit the ba when he is around! This is a nice place to grab a sandwich and a draft beer. Gay friendly, but not all gay. We went on a monday (yesterday eve). It was Labor Day, not crowded at about 5:30pm. My first time there. I got the rueben sandwich and a salad (instead of fries). Salad was crisp and fresh, rueben was good but note that there is very little meat in the sandwich but it was still ok. It was $8 or $7.something.  A friend got the mac and cheese with bacon. A lot of food and very good, but a tad pricey at $9. The 3rd in our group got the Monday special: a small steak, baked potato, brocolli, and side salad all for $9,50. Very good deal. The service was VERY slow. The bartender was also the server. He was busy talking with the two guys sitting at the bar or going outside to smoke to give us any decent service. But who is in a rush? Glad we were not. So do not get the rueben til they start putting more meat but the other meals, the atmosphere, all worth it. h and maybe do not go on mondays...get a different server that way. we had a rough week, and had been meaning to come here for some time. we came for lunch 12-22-12. began with a bloody mary, and a corona. next, i chose the veggie s. and m. burger on wheat with a salad and oil/vinegar. my partner had the traditional s. and m. burger with fries. the drinks hit the spot, and the food was delicious. our server/bartender was the best...he was so efficient, funny, friendly, and very customer-focused...we will be back...thanks so much... Atmosphere here is great, there is a pool table for those that are interested.  My server was very friendly and funny. My only complaint (which is kind of silly), is the well vodka is foul.  I am not a picky drinker and order well often, but I ordered a drink and a friend did also, both of us could barely choke it down.  Neither were made incorrectly... they were definitely what we ordered, but the vodka was a little odd... almost bitter.  I cannot really fault the establishment though, because you can simply choose another brand of vodka; I would recommend they look into switching that out though and again, I am really not picky with that stuff.  We will definitely be back! I have gone a couple of time in the past year to Fox & Hounds (little bar/food joint) because it is conveniently located near my job.  It is a dive but I continue to go.  Everytime I go the service is late.  This last time I went is the LAST time I will ever go!!!  Let me break it down for you...\\n\\nI walk in and the waiter (they only have one) looks me directly in the face as I walk myself to a booth.  He continues to take care of the table he is serving at the time.  He walks around the bar and walks behind the bar and gets their drinks ready.  He continues to go back to their table with their drinks and will not look at me...keep in mind I am right behind him.  He walks back to give the cook their orders and then walks behind the bar to chitchat w/the barflies.  I am staring him down the WHOLE time.  He then goes and gets their food from the cook area.  At that time I go and get my own menu!  I walk back to my booth and he is right behind me!!!  He serves that last table with their food and goes back behind the bar to chitchat.  Finally...20 minutes later he comes over as if nothing is wrong.  He has stupid smile on his face like he knows he should apologize!!!  But he does not!  By this time my date (fiance) had shown up and we order.  By the time we are get our food we eat a couple of bites and have to box it up and leave!  Never once did he apologize or anything.  I have, like I said, been to this place a couple of times and every time I feel like I do not get the service that I deserve!!! Cheap good food.  Besides just being across the street from work, the best part about going there is Jeff, the bartender.  LOVE him.  I have only been there for lunch during work, so I have not tried any drinks, but the food is good for bar food. DO NOT GO HERE\\n\\n(To the owner, feel free to get in contact with us)\\n\\nseriously we used to be regulars and have gone to this bar for over a DECADE!\\n\\nThis is the last time we will ever go to this bar. \\nYou had many chances and disappointed our group every Sunday for the last couple months.\\n\\nIt is Sunday and we called around 2pm, told them a large group of us will be showing up again. (usually ends up being around 10-15 people, plus others who join us and some who leave during our regular meet-ups) They told us they would be open their POSTED HOURS.\\n\\n(That means you were supposed to be open until 11 every Sunday night)\\n\\n we got there and the lights were off and doors locked, it is now only 6:50pm.\\n\\nThe last time we all tried to meet here, (we meet every Sunday here around 7pm) they told us they were no longer serving food for the day because the grill kept catching fire. (Ok I guess)\\n\\nBut then we ordered fried food and eventually (after three orders of only being able to choose from french fries or tater tots, are you kidding me!?) they told us they were no longer doing fried food either!\\n\\nI am more then sure at this point, as is the rest of the group, they just did not want to make food.\\n\\nThey closed an hour and half EARLY last Sunday\\nAn hour early the Sunday prior. \\nAnd many times before that.\\n\\nI work in the service industry, I UNDERSTAND wanting to go home, however I suck it up since I chose the field and job. I work 50/60+ hours a week so I really really understand that. But as a manager who covers shifts and volunteers to close, no matter how slow it might get, I ALWAYS stay open. ALWAYS have everything stocked and KNOW my inventory!\\n\\nIF ITS ON THE MENU,  YOU SERVE IT. PERIOD.\\n\\nDO NOT LET YOUR KITCHEN STAFF COME UP TO THE FRONT OF THE BAR COMPLAINING THAT SOMEONE GOT THEM SWISHER SWEETS INSTEAD OF SOME OTHER CIGARETTES WHILE CURSING LOUDY IN FRONT OF YOUR GUESTS.\\n\\nHOLY MOLY LADY! GOSH HECKIE YOUR STAFF IS A JOKE. \\n\\nFrom one business owner to another. The biggest regret I had when I bought my restaurant was not letting go of staff members who kept dragging it down and had repeated customer service issues. (Everyone gets a second chance) Eventually I let them go and I actually saw a lot of my regulars returning to me. \\n\\nYou should probably let some people go and start covering shifts yourself. Who knows, you might get customers back. \\n\\nI hope other customers step up and complain so you know what the in the world is going on at your bar.\\n\\nGet your staff and your service back in order.\\n\\nYou have lost a large group of customers and although we will be open to talking about a bunch of issues, we will not be returning to this bar again. That is a minimum of 10+ people your staff has alienated. I always knew Fox & Hounds to be a gay dive bar on the level that the Dirty Duck was, so I never really gave it a chance.  Recently a colleague of mine said she loved to go there after work, which I found odd given how I just described the place.  But yesterday I found myself there for some pool and cheap drinks (Hot Toddies for $5.50) and a friendly crowd.   \\n\\nTo me it still seems apparently gay, but I guess I am a little more in tune with the cues.  My straight colleagues still enjoy themselves, as it should be.  It does not feel divey or dirty at all, probably due to their recent remodel.  I know I will be back here for drinks with co-workers and some good games of pool. F&H is an unassuming sexless gay bar, where they pour cheap, strong drinks, the regulars are hardcore drinkers and the decor and  lighting are atrocious (akin to a Shari's). Fried food, bad music,  tube TV's and video poker add to the ambiance. \\n\\nIn sum, it is too brightly lit,  the vibe is lackluster, the dicks are limp but the drinks ARE stiff.\\n\\nL'Chaim! I am feeling nice so giving them three stars because things turned around in the last year for me here. I have often wondered what I need to do in order to get half decent service here. It is taken me nearly five years and they treat me better, but still, worse than Denny's.\\n\\nThanks for having such a big menu, there are some edible things on it, which is more than most gay places in this town. I have got stories though... Moldy fried food, and a taco with a raw corn tortilla? Imagine trying to eat that?\\n\\nI go there because my friends who have been around longer go there and they have more money, flirt with the staff and tip them big. I guess that is how it is done... Echoing what the previous reviewers said...total dive bar.  However,  I had a really great experience there and plan on going back when I come back to Portland.  The staff were all friendly and attentive, my drink did not stay empty long without one of the servers asking if I needed another (yes please!).  The drinks themeselves were strong and cheap (ahhh the way I like them!), the food was decent considering the dive-y-ness of the place, the music was fun and the patrons were also friendly and a lot of fun.  There were four of us in our party, and we escaped with plenty of drinks and nibbles for under $60.00, which was worth an additional star. I have been going to the Fox and Hound for over 20 years and always had a good time and ran into lots of friend.  WHAT HAPPENED!!!  Does not feel like a gay bar anymore and Friday nights are dead!  What happened to our friendly bartender- Joe.  Always had great service and a good time.  The last 2 Fridays were horrible!!!! Do not know if I will go back! I have been to the Fox and Hounds a few times and have never been disappointed. I am not a \\\"sit at the bar type a guy\\\" so all my experience comes from sitting at the normal tables. The food, drinks, and service has always been extremely good. As with any place, challenges do arise. However, the one time that it did, the staff was extremely apologetic and took care of the problem right away. As with all the other reviews, the place is beautiful and very inviting to all. Thank you, Fox and Hounds. I will definitely keep coming back. I went here to meet someone for brunch.  To my surprise it was pretty nice.  I had an omelet and coffee for $8.which is a really low price for what you get.\\n\\nThe waiter was a bit absent minded, but it kind of gave the place character.  \\n\\nThe place is a staple low cost place to eat for the local gay community.\\n\\nThis is located just one block from the Chinatown/downtown stop on the Red or Blue MAX light rail trains. Always a favorite place for a good, solid, simple weekend breakfast without the Portland brunch wait. Excellent service. Generous cocktails. Affordable. And, yes, it is a gay bar but we straights are made perfectly welcome. Super nice people. And yes, you may have to maneuver around a couple of street people, but that is Old Town Portland. All good! When I say we get around.. we get around.. ;) Stopped in here Friday night after we could not get into the other place we planned so we had to pass the place we were supposed to go and ended up in this place. Had a few drinks in here, the atmophere was nice and friendly. Had a great time just kicking back and having a few. While I would have liked to go dancing.. that is ok.. I can be just as at home in a place like this if not more. \\n\\nI love pursuing downtown when you do not have a car to worry about.. you just from place to place and then you figure out where to catch the max and go home! So much easier and you frequent lots of bars that way too. Just walk from one to the next.. no problem! Would go in here again. They really do look after thier customers! Fox & Hounds is one of those places that is set off from the main path and once you find it, you are glad it is. The atmosphere is pleasant even when it is filled with regulars. It is a great place to grab a beer or a bite and read a book or just be alone with your thoughts but it is also a great place to gather with friends. \\n\\nService is prompt and efficient and provided by a warm, friendly staff. I have never felt rushed here even when they are visibly busy. You are given the feeling that you are your servers' or bartenders' only customer and these days, that kind of service is a rare find. \\n\\nThe menu is descriptive and offers better than the average bar fare. Try the Mac n Cheese with bacon...creamy goodness served with your choice of soup or salad. Generous portions so anticipate taking half your meal home with you. \\n\\nDrinks are cheap and strong. I know what you are thinking, nuff said! This place sucks. I asked for shots for my friends and was told that the bartender did not \\\"feel like making shots\\\" so we were only allowed beers. What kind of bar does that? He also told us that if we ended up at his bar, we were probably kicked out of a club nearby. Not true at all for our crew, but I guess that is the type of crowd this bar attracts...\\n\\nNo wonder this bar is huge and only has two people other than us on a Friday night. After my second offensive attempt to have a drink at CC's (see my review), I discovered this gem of a bar.  I cannot recommend it enough.\\n\\nNice decor, super bartender's, hot looking AND friendly customers, and an above par drink.\\n\\nWhat more can you ask for? Have Not been here in awhile. Found out its under new management. Prices are still low drinks are still good. New menu. New pool tables.Got To love this place. Like with any gay bar in Portland, do not expect attentiveness on your first few visits - unless you are really cute. Bartenders are efficient, not unfriendly and pour a good drink. The beer taps are probably pretty average for Portland and likely will provide something palatable for discerning beer drinkers. \\n\\nIf you hang around the bar a bit you will notice that the bartenders and some of the regular customers can get rather catty at times - particularly when the odd unknowing group of apparently straight people walk in the door. This can be off-putting or enjoyable depending on your tastes. However, it all seems pretty harmless and just in fun.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty comprehensive and VERY inexpensive. I have tried a few items on the menu and been impressed with the quality. The cook is really very good.  \\n\\nThe place is comfortable, there are several TVs. Do not expect to catch the latest sporting event though. Fine by me. \\n\\nIt really is a nice place to check out particularly with a group of friends. Grab a table if you are seeking a semi-private conversation. Sit at the bar if you enjoy eaves-dropping on (or participating in) the cattiness. Fox & Hounds has been a starting place, mid-party rehydration station, and last stop to some of my best evenings in Portland.  The place is dark and divy, but the staff are always friendly and cheerful.  They make a STRONG long island which is a necessity on any night out in Portland.  It is within walking distance to events like Blow Pony and places like CC Slaughters and Whiskey Bar.  In the middle of the night when you and your friends need a mini break from the party, another drink, and a clean bathroom, go to Fox & Hounds.  Pull up a chair, share a drink, and get a little quality chat time in with your friends before rejoining the party. If you want a place to dine that is fabulous in all areas, make your way to Fox And Hounds.  Great food and fabulous people. Wow!!!!! I posted some photos of Rick and Jeff. These guys make a restaurant experience memorable  Thanks Rick for the awesome service Cannot believe the service tonight.  Girl behind the bar seemed off possibly on something or had been drinking.  It should not take more than 15 minutes to to get a drink or bottle of beer. We usually come in on Saturday nights and the bartender who has worked there for years and should be experienced is slow and more interested in idle chit chat than serving customers! Leaving will not be back! First time here, and my last. Sat at the bar, and was forced to witness the drunken owner verbally abuse and humiliate his staff in front of a a bar full of customers. As a customer service business owner myself, I was shocked to see an owner behave this way. I heard from a regular customer seated next to me that this happens often here, and that they cannot keep staff as a result. I am surprised this place has not been busted by the OLCC since the owner is drunk while on the premises. The food was good, though, and the staff did their best, given who they have to work for. This place has solid food and the the new owner is proactive to to say the least. and I know they have been going through a lot of changes. I have worked in the industry long enough to know things get weird and unpredictable. It is a good bar do not bitch about food issues. If you cannot afford a nice brunch or steak at real restaurant that does not those things do not bitch about the BAR you are sitting in. Have a drink chill out...Jim... maybe have a more understanding humble point of view...coming from a church goer.\",\n          \"Beer menu is limited but decent, food items are fresh and delicious. Ambient is comfy and spacious, prices are OK for the area. Great FL Beer selection. Friendly bar service and nice fresh vegetables to go. I like this place a lot! We have had beer so many times from here. But honestly we get wine and charceuterie from la femme de Fromage. Unfortunately they disappointed us so we sat at Florida and co. Wonderful experience with perky staff (Jennifer) and good alternative food option from houndstooth The food is amazing. The drinks are great craft brews and mimosas. The environment is chill and relaxing! Great place Friendly staff, locally grown and produced products, craft beer and even personal hygiene products... What more can you ask for? Cute bar too! Nice little local hotspot inside East End Market just as you enter. The beautiful natural wood counter invites their customers in to their bar stool seating. The staff are welcoming and knowledgeable on their only local ingredients menu. To be honest, we only came for the drinks menu, but they do serve what looks to be delicious food.\\nMy other half ordered their very affordable beer flight, which included 5 beer samples for just $10! I on the other hand orders their Shrub which is a flavored vinegar with sparking wine or water. Let us just say he got the better end of the deal. Even though their options for beer are limited on draft, the options were tasty. As for me, I should have just stuck with me gut and gotten wine. The Bees Knees with sparkling water was boring. It tasted like just like water at first then a sour honey at the end. I gave it another try with their Mayhaw Berry option, which was not any better. To tart for my taste unfortunately.\\nNeedless to say I am sure we will be back for their beer flight again and just avoid the Shrubs and order their food the next go around. Shout out to Florida & Co for repping the sunshine state HARD! From locally sourced ingredients, to brews from all over our lovely state- this spot is showcasing the flavors of all the fun under the Florida sun.\\n\\nDavid was awesome - and helped to prepare a great Beer Flight for me. From stouts to ciders, I got a chance to try 5 different beers. My two favorites were the Apple Cider from Keel and Curly as well as the Key Lime Beer from Key Billy. \\n\\nI also had a chance to try the Shrimp and Grits my momma ordered. This was as hearty as you would expect a shrimp and grits to be, but not as decadent as your traditional southern preparation. \\n\\nMade with coconut oil instead of butter, the bowl of grits was topped with hearty portions of shrimp, greens, peppers and onions. It was so flavorful and almost too pretty to eat!\\n\\nThis spot has high top tables and a good amount of bar seating, but they will also bring your food outside if you decide to dine al fresco.\\n\\nThey have also got a good selection of wines - even some wine on tap! They offer flights of wine as well which is fun. We discovered this little gem while waiting to  get into Domu. We took the server's suggestion, ordered a beer off their featured list and got the small plate Red Snapper Ceviche w/ plaintain chips (i do not know why it says chips, they were delicious, juicy and thick like normal fried plantains). I thought the ceviche was kind of sharp/acidic but my boyfriend loved it. Definitely recommend the ceviche on top of the plaintain to cancel out some of the acidity (even if it is a bit hard to scoop).\\n\\nCannot wait to visit again! : ) A place you can buy local groceries and drink local beer and wine too?! What a unique concept!\\n\\nI have not drank here yet, but I am very familiar with many of the brews they have on tap and sold as bottles. They are all high quality craft beers, all of which look to be brewed right here in Florida. One side of their grocery counter acts as a bar, where about 5 people can sit and enjoy their beer. You will also see people sitting outside drinking too.\\n\\nSo far I have only bought a dozen eggs here, picked locally, for $4 a dozen. These are the same eggs you might have seen at the Audubon Park Farmers market. Browsing through their selection, they also have all local arugula, lettuces, heirloom tomatoes, squashes, and frozen meats. Plus spices and bottles of vanilla.\\n\\nI am looking forward to having a cold local beer here one of these days. Went for the first time two days ago and was extremely impressed!  The pesto meatballs over zucchini \\\"pasta\\\" was fabulous as well as the ceviche, which was equally good.  It was great to be able to drink a grapefruit mimosa with fresh grapefruit pulp in it.  Yummy.  The decor and ambiance was steller!  I highly recommend. Great beer election, very helpful staff. They also have a variety of different products ranging from produce to beard cleanser to vanilla extracts. If you are in Orlando, you absolutely must visit the East End Market and stop by Local Roots. Love east end market overall as a whole but the service at Florida & Co beer was not good at all. We sat,  the guy working took several minutes just to greet us and when he did it was not friendly..as if we were a bother. There were only 2 other patrons and he engaged them 100% of the time, non-stop talking  about himself and his plans.  Very disappointing as I am a local and visit this place often. One should engage, conversation with all customers,  be friendly to all. Thankfully there are other great local shops here with excellent customer service! Florida & Co. is the first place (on the left) when you walk in the front entrance at East End Market.  It used to be called Local Roots, but has been going through a branding change.  My husband and I ordered brunch from  Farm Haus (at the back left of East End) and then sauntered over to the bar at Florida & Co.\\n\\nWe were quickly greeted by two staff members that saw us eyeing their draft menu.  They provided recommendations based on the types of beers we like and my husband and I both ended up with drafts that we enjoyed.  The staff said that we could sit at their counter and eat/drink or we could wander around East End Market with our beers, no need to feel stuck there.  As we were waiting on our food to be ready, we took a seat at the bar there, and remained there eating once we got our food.\\n\\nThe offer locally sourced items such as meat, beer, body products, and honey.  Some of the items seemed a bit pricey to me, but others were what I expected at any market or grocery store.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and chatty with those the customers that were also chatty.  Overall, a great first beer at Florida & Co.  I am sure we will continue to check out what they have on tap during our visits to the Market. This is an awesome place to find Florida local items. I love shopping small and shopping local, and this place kills two birds with one stone, as it were. They have everything from local craft beers to t-shirts that let you showcase your local love with a great shirt!\\n\\nI will be headed back to snatch up the honey butter in the cold case. Could not take it on my last visit since I was not headed home, and it needs to be kept cool.\\n\\nThe staff greeted my sister and I right away and offered help on anything we wanted more info on. I also fell in love with the local roots t-shirt that had the Orlando city skyline on it. \\n\\nOverall: A\\nThis place rocks. I love local stuff and this place has it all! Amazing first experience. Ordered the Southern spicy with Florida white shrimp with a soft egg. Was extremely delicious, I was licking the bowl. Had the right balance of citrus and spice! What can I say it was delicious. Located at the front of the East End Market, Local Roots Farm Store offers a nice selection of items. Greens, veggies, farm fresh eggs, meats and nice locally made pantry items like Mannix Vanilla, grits and home and bath products. \\n\\nThe beautiful wood bar offers up a nice spot to enjoy Quantum Leap wines and Florida brewed craft beers. (Including Cask & Larder) Try a flight and sample your way through some great wines or craft brews. Local Roots offers wifi and a spot to sit down to enjoy your delicious sandwich from Hounds Tooth or maybe La Bretxa. Service is attentive and warm, if you prefer to soak up the beautiful Florida day, it is OK to take your glassware outside to the picnic tables or enjoy the courtyard. I love East End Market and Local Roots is one of the tenant merchants that help cement that love! This is the store that helps make EEM a market. I am able to stop by, pick up some bread, local meat, eggs, and a bottle of something fun!\\n\\nAs previous reviews have mentioned, LR has a fabulous wooden counter that you can sit at while sipping on local wine and beer (sometimes they even have rare brews!). I have also sat there having a coffee from Lineage when EEM was fairly empty and they had no problem with this. \\n\\nThey carry various seasonal greens, local organic meat & poultry, eggs ($4/dozen~ I can dig those prices!), locally-made greeting cards, lotions & elixirs, etc. I always get my eggs here now since they are so cheap and who can beat local, free-range eggs? No one. That is who.\\n\\nBut what always keeps me coming back is the service (is not it  always that?). The person behind the counter is always incredibly nice and always seems genuinely interested in the customer. Last time I was there I bought some eggs, mentioned that they were for my sister's after-wedding brunch, and the woman gushed to my sister and wished her so much happiness and love. It was so nice and more than just a quick 'congrats.' \\n\\ntl;dr - Great eggs, great service = 5 stars Great selection of local and regional beers on tap and they have a sampler platter my favorite! The good service others rave about was absent during my recent weekend morning visit. A buddy and I sat down to eat food from the bakery across the hall - it was already 82 degrees at 11 a.m. and we did not want to eat outside. \\n\\nThe Local Roots \\\"bartender\\\" said he only had beer and wine. No cold non-alcoholic drinks. He filled a pitcher with warm tap water (no ice), poured us each a glass and then put the pitcher out of reach. We downed the waters quickly - we would been out biking - and started at our empty glasses while he spent five minutes counting coins in his coin box.\\n\\nNot wanting to be a pain I waited a while before getting up, walking over, and asking for a refill. He obliged - and then put the warm water pitcher out of reach again before walking off to adjust the twine holding the price tag to the kale basket at the back of the store. Same thing again, staring at empty glasses. There were 0-2 other customers in the store this whole time. \\n\\nI understand that we were not paying customers, but the bartender lost a chance to build goodwill and attract a future customer that would evangelize for a business that looks like it needs all the evangelism it can get. What would I have done in his shoes?\\n\\n- Poured the pitcher and then left it for us to \\\"self serve,\\\" freeing him to other duties\\n\\n- Gotten ice for the pitcher without putting the customer in the awkward position of being the 'I am only here drinking free water, and now you are asking me if you should walk across the building on my account for some ice' guy\\n\\n- Poured a couple little taster glasses of beer and slipped them in front of us unbidden. If we turn them down, the bartender just wasted 50 cents of product. If we drink them, he is got customers for life. (\\\"Hey! I am that bartender's best friend! He just gave me a free beer!) Local Roots, you better clear out a permanent stool at your bar for me. I love your variety of all things Florida. From carrying local beers and wines to handmade hards and deli items. Aside from the eye catching wooden bar, the unique wooden taps truly draw a passerby's attention in. While we were a bit disappointed that we could not score a space at the bar to enjoy our Original Sin Pear Cider, we were more than happy to get some vitamin D with our brew at one of the outdoor picnic tables. \\n\\nI could reiterate all the positive things that the reviewers before me touched upon, but what stood out in my mind is the supremely chill vibe given off by the gents running the counter. They were helpful and very efficient despite every seat being taken at the bar. I loved the homemade feeling of everything, like I was welcomed at the counter in their personal kitchen. The chalkboard with the tap listing was a bit small, but it was effective in drawing us up to the counter to take a closer look. \\n\\nI hope I can time my next visit better, so I can pick the brains of the staff and learn more about their business. Those visiting EEM, make this a pitstop on your list whether you are buying a beverage or finding something deliciously local to take home with you. We fancied ourselves a beer while munching on our grilled cheese from La Femme du Fromage (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-femme-du-fromage-orlando?hrid=6G5cYcOnpwibl63Eib6mCA) and Local Roots was able to fill that need. With local beers on tap & the option to get a flight we were able to taste several beers from around the Sunshine State. \\n\\nLoved the wooden bar! Such a cool design. While we did not purchase anything on this visit, I did love perusing the wares of the shop and thinking about what I might need to pick up next time. If I lived around the corner in the neighborhood, this would be the perfect place to stop to pick up something for dinner. \\n\\nThe gentleman behind the bar was super friendly and did not rush us in any way even as the crowd started to pick up around lunch time. There is plenty of seating (~15 stools) at the bar so you should not have too hard a time finding a place to sit. Absolutely love this cute and local vendor at East End Market! Florida & Co. serves local craft beers as well as wine and sparkling cocktails. I am excited to try their food menu next. Apparently you get 25% off your tab when you eat dinner here, even alcohol. Do yourself a favor and try the shrubs. It sounds weird, but they are so good. They are more of an elixir that they mix with sparkling soda or champagne. I loved the hibiscus and Mayhan the best. And if you are looking to try a different wine or beer offered, go for the flights. They are a great deal. You can bring your drinks around the market or even go outside and listen to the live band that might be there. Or just sit at the bar and enjoy some friendly conversation with Emily and Perrin. One of my favorite dishes is shrimp & grits.  The dish as prepared  by Florida & Co offers a delicious healthier option to the traditional southern dish.  Not the less in flavor, it is prepared with coconut oil and adds Swiss chard and kale along with savory shrimp and an egg on top. The ingredients are locally sourced and are fresh   It is a dish worth repeating.  The setting is so nice. You can eat outside or inside at counter seating. They serve wine and also some craft beers on draft. I Cannot wait for the next time I am visiting the area to stop in at East end Market to try it again. Florida & Co is so good it will change your mind about Orlando. It proves it is more than a city just centered around touristy Disney World and full of gross, fried food. WRONG! \\n\\nFlorida & Co is a locally sourced restaurant inside the cool East End Market that prioritizes low sugar foods. On top of that, they sell some of Florida's best craft beer and ciders.\\n\\nI ordered the Mojo bowl or lunch with brown rice, kale, sweet peppers, orange slices, and Florida wild shrimp. It was all steamed and came with a light lime garlic sauce. It was so good, healthy, and balanced the flavors well (the orange slices were perfect and, yes, you are meant to eat the orange peel).\\n\\nThe drink list is really good and they always have a local cider on tap. I ordered the acai cider from Accomplice Brewery and it was one of the best drinks I have ever had.\\n\\nOn top of that, the space is beautiful with a few tables off to the side and a long wood bar to sit at. Also, the service is excellent and friendly! Claim to be a small craft brewery specialist, does not even know the difference between white IPA and a pale ale... food is pretty good but owner is incompetent, decent experience but made it hard to enjoy a beer due to bad attitude. Stick too food here This place is a wonderful staple in the East end market. The last few times I have been here have been as a layover type visit- while waiting on a table at Domu or just for cheese (from the fromage) and beer but I need to change that as their menu has expanded and looks rather tasty AND healthy. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the local craft beers they have and are always willing to let you sample something before you decide. The bar front seating can be limited but they are more than willing to let you sit outside with drinks and will deliver food to you outside as well. I came here a few weekends ago with friends and it was so amazing! It is located inside East End Market so a great place to hangout on a Saturday or Sunday morning. They have ample seating space, extremely friendly employees, and a menu full of feel-good, delicious meals and snacks. I ordered the Florida Bowl with Shrimp. It did take a few minutes to prepare, but I was the first customer of the morning and they prepared everything fresh which was nice. The bowl began with a bed of rice, a hearty portion of greens, ample pickled vegetables, and a deliciously light cilantro-lemongrass sauce. Four or five large shrimp adorned the top of the bowl. \\n\\nI absolutely loved this! First of all, it was piping hot and extra comforting on a rainy morning. At $15 a bowl, you really get a perfect sized portion-- enough to feel like you have got your money's worth, but not simply loaded with cheap fillers. The cilantro-lemongrass sauce was truly a standout. A lot of times I order things with sauce on the side because they are too often heavy handed in the application, or way too oily. There was just the right amount of sauce added to this bowl and it was not loaded down with weird oils. Absolutely wonderful-- highly recommend! I was really excited to come to this place to try some ceviche. I am not sure if it was the advertising , but it looks delicious. Surely enough it was. However their is always more then one aspect to a dining experience! Let us take it from the top! \\n\\nI would like to start with the parking. Which you have to acknowledge as lackluster. It is understandable, for a market that shares space with several different kinds of businesses. However, space is available right outside of East End as it does tend to fill up quickly and for many hours on end. All within a short walking distance and free. No worries! \\n\\nFlorida and Co is located right up front on your left as soon as you enter. The aesthetic immediately captures your attention and if seafood is your thing, then it will also captures your tastebuds. Upon seating ourselves and reviewing the menus. We ordered 2 waters which were filled a quarter full each time (including the one refill). I am not sure if that is part of the experience or not. No big deal, I finally settled upon ordering the ceviche bowl and anxiously awaited as I contained my growling stomach! \\n\\nMy favorite time arrived as I received my food within minutes and was extremely excited to eat this meal. I went with the jasmine rice option as well and really hoped for a nice heaping bowl of ceviche for $15. To my dismay, I received the bowl, minus the heaping. It turned out to be enough food for about half the actual size of the bowl. In all fairness, the food was absolutely delicious. The fish was very fresh and the acidity and lime really work well together in the ceviche. The onions are proportionate and the jasmine rice is to die for. \\n\\nA restaurant is much more than a food establishment though, it is at its heart. A service based business. I would like to mention Kristen as a very nice and helpful employee. I say this because Kristen turned out to be the only one their that morning who actually put on a nice friendly smile and sought to uphold the customer service standard. Aside from that, I must note that the service in general was bad. After paying for my purchase and putting the tablet on the table for my girlfriend to pay for her meal, the  employee across from us snatched the tablet and gives it to a couple next to me, forcing us to awkwardly wait for someone to check out before us in the middle of us checking out. That was really uncomfortable for me. I still left a tip because I appreciate the hard work small business go through and just want to show my support in anyway possible. \\n\\n\\nOverall, the food is good here. I do not warn anyone against going here. If ceviche or seafood is your thing, you might want to go for it. As for me, Unfortunately, I will not be back, but I do have high hopes for the future of this business! Their food is just amazing. Have you ever had the first bite of something and literally say \\\"OH MY GOD\\\" this is so good and just be in  over it? Lol yeah this places does that to me every time. Everyone who works there is also super nice and helpful. Love love love. If you have not tried it you MUST! Every time I hit up East End, I always go to Gideon's and Domu. But this time I finally gave the other spots a try, which led me to the zucchini noodle bowl at Florida & Co. they are clearly capitalizing on the fad diets of New Years Resolutions, which is fine by me! The zucchini was crunchy and it soaked up that great pecan pesto sauce. Topped it with their homemade meatballs and red sauce, and I was in heaven. The bowl packed flavor and savor and it satisfied my pasta needs. We came here for another establishment but on our way out of this indoor farmers market type place we made a pit stop. My husband tried a sample of the Central 28, Upriver American Pale Ale 6%. He enjoyed it so much he went ahead and got a glass for $7.00. \\n\\nI will say their beer pairs well with Gideons cookies. 5 Stars for all of the reasons mentioned in my prior review and now some fabulous prepared food!\\n\\nThere is still the local beers, locally made products, and tasty wines, but what was once Local Roots is now Florida & Co., and it provides another great option for prepared food at East End Market.\\n\\nI took a seat at one of their round high top tables and ordered the (local meat) meatball sandwich and a rice bowl of pickled veggies, lettuce, and shrimp. Of course, I forgot to take a picture of the menu, so I do not have the official names of these dishes, but it seems like anything you order off this menu is going to be quality and full of flavor.\\n\\nThe meatball sandwich was hearty and had enough acidity to leave you feeling light afterwards. Which is the first time I can remember feeling that after a meatball sub. The rice bowl had thinly sliced pickled cucumbers, carrots, and beautiful lettuce leaves (I want to say butter lettuce, but I am not great at identifying greens...). But the star of the dish was the shrimp. There were plenty of perfectly seasoned shrimp (no poop vein!) and a bite of pickled vegetables with shrimp is flavor perfection!\\n\\nService was great (thanks, David!) and the round tables gave more privacy for lunch meetings than when you used to only have the bar as an option. There is not as much selection in terms of produce or local gifts, but that is been replaced with really, really good food. So, overall, a great change!\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1075,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Can't comment on customer service since I just ordered online for delivery.  I would order again if I'm working in the area again. This Jimmy Johns is the worst that I've been to and I frequent them a lot. The staff are not friendly and the subs are very thin, not worth the money. Food tastes as expected (what you want from a chain). Took close to forty minutes and I was a mile away - not freaky fast. The beach club is my favorite! Awful! I ordered my food at 11:05 and didn't receive it until 1:40. Customer service was awful. The service here was horrible.  Staff is very unfriendly!  I had to tell the girl 3 times before she got my order correct and then she acted like it was my fault.  I will not be coming back.  The jalape\\u00f1o chips are good but their tuna tasted like it died a slow painful death. \\\"Freaky Slow\\\" should be this locations motto. I ordered online and 15 minutes before arriving to the store and when I got here I had to wait another 15. Very poorly managed store, absolutely ridiculous, they even have a huge staff on hand. Ok let's start by say the loud music as if I'm walking into a night club. Then I look at the menu before I get to the cash register and I stand the for a minute before I say something to the guy that is standing there and refuse to face me to take my order WTH. Then he whispers do you want cheese on that and I said yes, come to find out I was charged extra for the cheese. WHAT IS A SANDWICH WITHOUT DARN CHEESE SMH IM DONE WITH PLACE. Now for the group of employees that make the place look like a hang out spot IM DONE DROPPING THE MIC My wife and I are here with out 2 yr old son.  We each ordered a sandwich and began to eat, feeding our son from our own sandwich.  We quickly realised he was only interested in the bread so went up to grab a day old bread for 50 cents. The kind gentlemen behind the counter asked if it was for the little guy and gave it to him for free, asking if we needed any sauces on it for him.  Give the place a shot; what a kind, selfless thing to do! Nice refreshing change of pace from the old fast food burger joints. My wife and I order from here regularly. The app works great for us and the delivery is always really fast.\\n\\nThe sandwiches are always correctly put together and the quality is great. You definitely get what you pay for. \\n\\nAs a suggestion, I always ask them to \\\"take some bread out\\\" when ordering the French bread, it helps to eat the sandwhich without losing the goods. What I don't understand how people manage to hire employees with bad attitudes and let them be the face of a business.3 employees working with no smile, no greeting and bad attitude like someone killed their cat. \\nWalked up to the counter and I get greeted with \\\"whatchu want\\\". Ordered a sub an Asked for a cup of water, got a dreadful reply \\\"we are out of water cups\\\" with absolutely no sense of remorse, let alone a \\\"sorry\\\". It's like I am not giving them business, they are doing me a favor by serving me.\\nIf you hate your jobs so much, don't spoil your customer's mood with bad attitude. Go find another job or leave your f-ing attitude at home. I ordered 2 sandwiches to be delivered. 45 mins later? I'm still waiting. Apparently the B Team is working because it would have absolutely faster to drive there myself, eat, and drive back. If you order delivery...really any time of the day... expect a call telling you they either \\\"don't have bread\\\" or they'll tell you they don't have a delivery driver. Freaky fast delivery? More like freakishly unpredictable and incredibly unreliable/nonexistent delivery. Absolutely obnoxious. Food is always fresh and good, however the service is terrible.  They never get the order right and the employees are rude and not helpful.  The GM is terrible.  AVOID Terrible customer service including the manager. Had a driver yell for not getting a tip, do better the food is still great I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but this jimmy johns not only got our order wrong twice when we were in the store, we realized after we had left that they had forgotten to put meat on two of the sandwiches. The sandwich also left my stomach very unsettled making me think I got a touch of food poisoning too. This jimmy johns needs some serious improvement. I've been here several times, and every time the service has not met Jimmy Johns status. My last visit is what pushed me to write this review and to not return.\\n\\n1. The lady making my sandwich was bossy and yelling at her kids while she was making my sandwich.\\n\\n2. They locked all the doors when they closed in an hour and a half. When I was unlocking the door to leave, the same lady demandingly yelled and told me not to unlock the door. How do you except me to leave? I ignored her and opened it anyway.\\n\\n3. Same lady lied to me. When she handed me my sandwich she said the bread was hard because it just came out of the oven. But it wasn't hot. I'm a professional baker, bread is hard because you burned it or its stale. I wasn't going to complain but don't lie to me. The bread wasn't enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n4. They are slow compared to most Jimmy Johns.\\n\\n\\nDon't yell at me don't lie to me and send your kids home. I'm used to getting fast, friendly service at Jimmy John's. This place was neither of those things. I was the only customer there, so it's not like they were too busy. The lady who was making my sandwich started to make it, and then stopped so she could finish her conversation with I coworker. The sandwich wasn't put together very well. I don't expect to visit this location again. Just like the commercials say, this place is FAST.  By the time I paid and finished putting my change in my wallet they were handing me a sandwich.  I thought they were accidentally handing me someone else's... LOL\\nOn my most recent visit, I ordered The Vito.  It was noticeably fresh with decent flavor, but it could have used a little more meat and liquid (oil, vinegar, mustard, mayo). \\nIf you are pressed for time though as I was on this day, this is your perfect lunch spot. First off customer service definitely lacked. Walking in it looked like they were closed. Crew members were sitting and leaning on tables and loud music was playing. The girl that took my order was slightly rude (making a comment to a sauce I wanted on my sandwich). When wrapping up my order, the same girl that took my order reaches into the pickle jar and takes a pickle with her BARE HANDS. Ew never will I ever come back to this establishment. No one wants to spend money at a place where the employees clearly don't care. This use to be my favorite Jimmy Johns location but the quality of workers has really brought the service down.  My last visit during my transaction the cashier (named Marie ) never spoke or looked at  me once..  I'm not kidding.  I walked in she stood next the register so i started giving my order, she put her hand out for my credit card and gave me a receipt.  I have to find a new favorite location. Walked in the other day. Ordered a sandwich to go. The gentlemen who helped me were very nice and accommodating. It was my first time ever being at a JJ's and they were patient and answered all my questions Sandwich was made fresh. Since I wasn't eating the sandwich right away, I was worried about it getting soggy. Not the case. I ate half and ended saving the other half for even later and it was still fresh! Even though I didn't eat it there, still a clean establishment. I called for a delivery order at 4 pm.  The lady taking my order was more interested in talking to someone else about going on breaks.  She was VERY RUDE to me (as a paying customer) and acting like I was interrupting her.  WTF Jimmy Johns.  I know you are better than this. \\n\\nSOO.... 30 minutes later (when my order should have been delivered) the same rude woman calls me back to let me know their delivery driver will not be in for work until 5 pm.  WHY WASN'T I TOLD THIS WHEN I ORDERED????  She offers no apology or any explanation.  She advises me that I can wait until their driver shows up for work OR I can come pick it up myself.  I cancelled the order. This location will not have my business any longer. \\n\\nThis Jimmy John's is terrible and DOES NOT live up to their company standards.  It's pathetic. Customer service at this location is the worst i have ever expirienced.  \\n\\nI called in an order. I may have as well gone through  a drive through.  You know what happens there.  You get F#@#@ed. \\n\\n I   asked if my special request had been fulfilled and was told  yes.  Upon return to work i found that the request was honored but my order was worng.  \\n\\nWhen i called to complain is when the horrible service began.  That store is run by incompetent extremely rude people.\\nI was  told that there  was no way to speak with the owner of this franchise location.  No response from a call i have in to him either.   I guess the poor service is from top to bottom.   Will never go there again. I didn't get his name, but the guy with dreads fixed my sandwich. His sandwich counter was filthy and he didn't follow any directions on light mayo, light mustard etc. Super fast but that because they barely made the sandwich. Turkey sandwich what could go wrong... let me tell you. \\nI had to search for the lettuce due to such a small amount even a friend asked if I ordered no lettuce. There was more mayo than turkey, I guess 1 slice of turkey is the spec because the whole office enjoyed their bread and mayo experience.  But it was fast.  Increase your quality and not just speed. I called in my order and when I got there girl was cleaning down and never made my food. Took off cleaning glove picked up new glove and made my tuna sandwich. But she was stoned and store smelled like trees, they had the door open. I walked into pot lounge. Never going back Horrible customer service and unprofessional delivery driver. Why would you call a customer to complain about an accidental tip online. You never know what someone has waiting on you IN CASH! Oh and they hang up on you too. Never give this location business. Hopefully they all lose their jobs in the next few months. I think Jimmy John's has a pretty good product. The meat is pretty fresh, as well as the lettuce. Their bread is pretty tasty too. You can expect to pay $7 and change for a sandwich or $11 and change for a combo. If their prices were a tad bit cheaper I'd say it's worth five stars. All in all it's a convenient, healthy option for lunch! Worst seen to date!! Ordered online and the app showed that it was made and out for delivery within 20 min... well, after an hour I called and they said they had to bake the bread and it was cooling and that they would make it in about 10 min. It was finally delivered 1 hr and 40 min after it was ordered. Almost TWO hours for a sandwich!!! WOW... This is the absolute worst Jimmy John's I've ever been to.  They are very slow, customer service is terrible, they can't make a sandwich like you ordered if their life depended on it.  They argue with you if you call them out on their error and insist you are wrong...  Um.... I'm the customer, remember?  I used to go here every week, but I don't think I'll be back unless there's a real turnover in employees.  It's a real shame too. Went to Jimmy Johns after work because nothing else was open for vegans around that area. This was around 9:20p. I got the veggie club. They started making the sandwich and said they were out of tomato. I said \\\"you don't have any at all?\\\". She was like yea but they're in the back and I would have to cut it. (With a attitude) She then looked at the time like I was wasted her time to close and clean up. This staff has always been over it and looked like they don't want to work there. Not surprising really. Giving two stars because she actually cut the tomato for me, attitude and all.\",\n          \"Food was adequate for what it was. My boyfriend ordered a Mojito, they had no mint, said nothing and instead ended up with what tasted like crystal light, vodka and too much lime juice....not terribly interested in returning. This is a dive that I used to go to, but do not anymore because of a proximity factor. As I said it is just a dive to meet and chat, have a drink with friends, and so expectations not being to high, it never really disappoints. Service is kind of lacking sometimes. I was happy with the Nachos. Wish there was more cheese on it. But the guacamole was top notch!\\n\\nHeads UP: They have a 50 cent charge for take out. Cheap drinks, lots of room, realy friendly bar tender, cheap pool, and lots of fun alcoholics. so cute. really close to the max and a great haven to escape from the crazies on skidmore. WTF.... Had to pay for food before even ordered ...Hmmm ever been to burger king if so EAT ThERE service is better and the food with out  a thought 10000 times better.\\nAs for service stay away from the bartender Joe just a wipe we brought my partner's parents here and had the veggie s/m burger with salad. my partner had the eggs benedict, and they shared the french dip with fries. everything was delicious, and the server was so friendly and efficient. love the atmosphere. Went in for lunch during the week and sat in a booth far away from the bar.  I think all the action was at the bar because we never got any service.  When we first sat down someone asked us what we would like and we said we needed a minute. Then no one ever came back.  After a while we just got up and left and ate some place near by because being ignored made us feel awkward and I didn't want to go ask for service and seem rude.  I'm just too passive to eat here. This is my fav lunch and dinner spot. The service is too notch and the food is excellent. There is a new owner who is committed to the bar and her employees. I really appreciate her commitment as a regular. They have switched up the menu and introduced craft cocktails! I recommend coming down to this spot for lunch, dinner or happy hour. I hear the brunch is spot on also I am excited for Pride! The place will be packed! I had no idea this bar was over here. In this side of town you just get used to your usual places unless you live downtown, work there or spend way too much time in bars...no offense...everyone needs hobbies right. I love the decor which seemed pretty butch and no dive bar at all - I was confused as to the reviews mentioning it as a dive since that was not the impression I got at all though I hear they went through a remodel. The staff were amazing and when we went there with a Barfly bus filled with 40 they slammed our drink orders out smoking fast. The drinks were well priced and well made too. Nothing screamed gay bar at all and there was a birthday party happening with catering and everything which was neat - that they can section off parts like that. My boyfriend and I frequent this bar, but not just for the drinks.  We are both big fans of the food.  Attention is paid to the quality of the meals you get and the prices are reasonably low for the the amount they serve you.  The service tends to be kind of spotty, a bit of a hit or miss sort of thing, but there are a few waiters/bartenders that make it all the more worth it to stop in.  It is conveniently located just off the max line and is very easy to find if you know what you are looking for, though we found that we had actually walked by the place several times without even being aware of it's existence.  It is relatively conservative inside on the decor, and not nearly as in-your-face as something like The Eagle, but you still sense a presence of acceptance and tolerance.  It is not uncommon to see men dressed as women at the bar ordering a drink and talking to the bartenders as old friends.  It's a welcoming environment.\\nMy only suggestion for the place would be to hire on a new waiter or two.  There have been several times my boyfriend and I have gone in and had to wait an unusually long time to have our orders taken, or to get our check.  We don't mind too much, especially considering there is typically 1-2 people working as bartenders and doubling as waiters.  It isn't there fault, I just hope that management notices that many of their customers aren't as tolerant to their short-staffed nature as my boyfriend and I are.  \\nAll in all, this place is a good time with great food.  Check it out when you're not in a hurry and ask about the specials-some of them are REALLY great deals.  Cheers! Absolutely HORRIBLE service!!!! Refused to give us water unless we bought alcohol first! Completely outrageous behavior from the bartender, will never go there again. Have never been treated so horribly I've been to Fox & Hounds a handful of times now, and each time it's the same bartender. That's comforting. It's a nice, \\\"old man bar\\\" - but, there aren't a lot of old men here, generally speaking. For a nice, quiet gay bar, I highly suggest this place. If C.C. Slaughters is too loud for you to talk, pop on in to Fox & Hounds and have a few drinks. \\n\\nThey have a pretty extensive menu, as well - including your old standby's of fried bar food. The French Dip is simple but quite good. The Jalapeno Poppers are a favorite. The Chicken Strips and Fries are quite sufficient and tasty. \\n\\nOne pool table, lots of seating, friendly establishment. The location to the dance club of Slaughters night life is perfect. I'd definitely try stopping in and not let previous reviews strip you of the opportunity to support this local establishment. A couple weeks ago, my friend and I went to Fox & Hounds for the Ladies of Rock drag show fundraiser for various charities. We got there super early and the servers were very attentive. My friend and I had just eaten dinner somewhere else and weren't really looking to order anything food/ drink wise, so we tried to stay under the radar with the ordering. Eventually the place filled up and we didn't have to keep saying we were waiting for friends to order. Anyway, I would definitely come here again for another drag show. I'm glad I didn't drink because the unisex bathrooms were kind of gross (why can't boys pee IN the toilet?) and I didn't want to have to go again. That's my only real criticism... I would not waste your time or money at The Fox & Hounds.  I went there with a friend the other night to grab some food and a beer.  The restaurant from the street looked inviting and the atmosphere pleasant.  We sat ourselves, per instruction from the sign in the entrance, and waited for our server.  We waited and waited and waited.  20 minutes later our server, real short hair and balding, pale in complection and rocking 2 tattooed arm sleeves, came over to us and apologized for the wait saying he didn't see us.  I wasn't sure how that could be as we were sitting in direct line of sight.  No problem, I'll take his word for it and let it go.  We got our menus and ordered beers right away.  20 minute wait made us thirsty.  Our server proceeded to take a beverage order for a table of 8 next to us.  Then he shot back up to the bar and began doing I don't know what.  At one point he removed his shirt to expose his white tank-top undershirt.  A little classless but whatever- I'm not judging.  10 minutes later the server came over with drinks in his hands for the table of 8.  That was the last straw for me and we got up and left.  Upon exiting the server asked us \\\"oh, are you guys leaving?\\\" Either he had no clue of his poor customer service on display or he just didn't really want to serve us.  Whatever way you look at it, it was poor poor service.  I wish I could comment on the food but we didn't get that far.  Portland has many, many food options and The F&H is not worth your time! It's not a busy Saturday afternoon but, a lot of dirty tables. Every ketchup bottle was almost empty it took three to get enough for my fries. Plus the bottles were all dirty. Napkins were non existent. No line at the bar but, I had to wait over five minuets to get a Coke while the bartender chatted with his friend. \\nBartender was super nice & food is improved over the old management but, some serious side work etc needs to be taken into consideration. One bus tub and about five minuets would have had the dining room looking neat. I hit Fox's regularly. It's like \\\"Cheers\\\" for the Portland gay crowd.  Food is reasonable and good, drinks are strong, and the atmosphere is warm, inviting, friendly.  Friday happy hour is great. The ambience is Cheers-esque, which happened to be playing on the tv above the bar when I was there for lunch recently. It's neighborhoody. There are regulars. The bartender learns your name. The service is very good--the bartender who is also the waiter during the day is warm without being over the top. He's sincere, low-key, and consistent.\\nThe food is actually pretty good. Some things shine--like their daily soups. The beer and cheese soup that I had was one of the best beer and cheese soups I've ever had. And their grilled cheese is just like mom used to make. On the surface, it's a three star joint. But something about it keeps inviting me back. So I'll throw it another star for that ineffable 'come back' quality. Been to this restaurant before, food and atmosphere were not anything special. Now, on their menu, they are blaming increased prices on new minimum wage laws. I will not in any way support a restaurant that takes worker protections out on their own employees. I feel bad for those people. Your employer is clearly terrible and you should probably seek new employment. Shame on you, Fox and Hounds. I will never return to your establishment and will encourage my friends, family and colleagues to do the same. If you have a problem with local laws, take it out on your legislators, not on your workers and the community. That was nice bar... Good taste ... Meeting friend and drink and eat .. Kind of relaxing place to go there ... The bartender is surprisingly rude & slow despite there being 9 people here not ordering, just listening to shitty 80's music and being old/bitter. \\n10ish minutes after ordering, they told us they didn't have the ingredients for what we ordered, and were uppity when we asked to see the menu again. They messed up my order, and what I got was an over-priced, dried out travesty. And everyone 45+ and/or bitter lesbian/gay got better service than us (young gays), point of order: came in after us, got food before us. That autistic guy isn't lying! And their fugly regulars decided to chime in when my friend had a \\\"difficult\\\" vegetarian order (#SorryNotSorry it's 2015 and you live in Portland). Not coming back. Good food, inexpensive drinks.  The dinner special on Friday was Prime Rib for $12.50!  How could you pass that up?\\n\\nI rarely had to wait at the bar for service, the bartender was friendly. Until last night, I had only been to Fox and Hounds once with a friend for a quick stroll through and once during Pride Week when everyone was drunk and acting crazy. \\nLast night, a friend and I went for happy hour and dinner.  This area of town seems to be really calm and slow until later at night, which is cool, if you just want a relaxed time.  There were maybe two other people when we arrived around 4:30 and then maybe four tables of people when we left.  \\nThe drinks were good and strong.  I had  crispy chicken salad, which was really good.  The chicken wasn't heavily battered and the salad had lots of different veggies.  I forgot to ask for no cheese as I'm trying to avoid dairy and they don't put any on it anyway, so I was happy.  My friend's club sandwich looked really good and he said it was. Prices were very reasonable. \\nThe bartender was low key, not super friendly but mellow.  I'd definitely recommend Fox and Hounds if you just want a mellow drink or meal, I've no idea what the later crowd is like. Well, the decor was beautiful, the food fantastic.  The bar staff was about as friendly and courteous as a plague infected rat.  Go there for the ambiance and the food, but don't except the welcoming committee...it doesn't exist there Small kitchen means you might be waiting for 4 tacos for 50 minutes on a Tuesday... that's with the bar at half capacity. I know there is a new owner and I think she would be best served by simplifying the menu. It is better to do a few things really well, than to do a lot of things slightly better than poorly. It's the only bar open for lunch in the area, they have a real opportunity to be a draw. I'll keep my fingers crossed. Worst experience ever. Just got into town & was looking for a quick meal & drink before a show downtown. This place liked decent and had customers inside, so I entered...I was gonna wet myself as I was finishing my coffee I'd been drinking during the trip so I immediately went into the restroom before making my way toward the bar (a sign in the entryway said \\\"Please seat yourself\\\" and there was no greeter). As I did a gentleman approached & said \\\"Hey man when you came in here you broke about 3 of my rules. You didn't talk to any of us, you had a backpack on, and you have a drink in your hand. Now get your ass out the door now!\\\" I tried explaining that I'd never been there so didn't know about \\\"his rules\\\", nor did I think I had to speak to anyone since the sign said seat yourself. However, anytime I tried to speak he just yelled \\\"Out the door\\\" over & over, louder & louder. Needless to say, I won't be coming here again & neither should you! Rude gay bar. I am straight and don't mind patronizing any business.  They have a beautiful bar and nice happy hour. The bartender, however, made me feel unwelcome. He was talking to other gay customers about an orgy he attended the night before. I really didn't care but decided to leave for a quieter place. After tipping him I turned to leave and he called me breeder.\\n\\nThe food menu is good. Yes, strong drinks, but do I have to deal with a rude waiter? This place should not discriminate against anyone, but I guess my Aspergers is not accepted here. I asked a couple simple questions and received rude responses and then I was targeted to receive my food last and only after I asked where my food was. Then I didn't get my bill when I asked. I won't be back if he is around. Fox and the Hounds has the honor of being my first 1 star review . If you haven't been through the gauntlet to be a regular, or aren't a rude mouthy lesbian, over the age of 40, or a desperate gay alcoholic, no reason to come here, unless you're craving bowling ally food, without the bowling ally. \\nDefinitely NOT a place everyone in the gay community can feel welcome, as a gay 20 something, I was absolutely appalled by the customer service. \\nI'm a hairstylist, so patron interactions are the single most important thing for me when it comes to my dining experience, and this was the worst I've ever had. I killed him with kindness to find the bartender had a headache, and was stressed from calling the cops on a drunk/over served 90 y/o regular.\\n I would give the place 2 stars because he wasn't feeling so great, but I have never been treated so horribly! And then another regular, a large butch women mocked me for my \\\"complicated\\\" order ( a veggie burger with no cheese or mayonnaise) I knew she was a regular because she asked about the bartenders recent vacation. \\nIt's almost laughable! How is this place still in business?! I live on the NW park blocks, and have been looking for a relaxed place to come to that wasn't the atmosphere of C.C's. Unfortunately, the search continues, and I'll make sure to let my friends and clients know where to NOT go for a good time. Wow! What has happened to Fox and Hound? I just went there for dinner, and it was horrible. First the blonde bimbo bartender was too busy talking to the three people that were at the bar but finally I ordered a drink. Told her I'd be at the table and I want to dinner. Literally the cook had to tell her that I was ready to order. I waited and waited for my salad which I asked for no onions. Finally the cook brought out my dinner and I had to tell him what about my salad. I got my salad covered in onions after my dinner was brought out. Got the chicken fried steak dinner it was so salty I could not even finish it. Then I had to go up to the bar to get my bill because she never came back over to the table. And she actually asked me \\\"oh did you have to drinks?\\\" Fox and Hound a hard no. Is this place even a gay establishment anymore? Apparently there is a new owner. She needs to work on customer service and the menu and hiring the right people. I give Fox & Hounds 4 out of 5 stars mainly because of the staff, who are very friendly and accepting of everyone. They make newcomers feel like regulars. \\n\\nIt is primarily a gay bar, but you could bring business clients there for lunch and never know it was a gay bar. Tasteful, conservative decor. Lots of straight people enjoy it as well. A good place to bring mixed sexuality groups, without making anyone feel uncomfortable. \\n\\nIf rated for their food, the score would be one star lower, I'm afraid. They rely too much on frozen, fried food. That having been said, though, their food is better than most bar food, and sometimes they really hit a home style daily special out of the park. And, their hamburgers are very reliable. Not quite gourmet burgers, but better than your average bar fare.\\n\\nThey have a Sunday brunch that is quite good if you arrive early and the food is still fresh. A friend and I stopped at this place today, Sat, Apr 26, '14, at about 3 pm.\\n\\nFood was ok, not great.  Drinks were a bit weak.\\n\\nBut the bartender (slender, about 48-49, short hair) was RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!!  No wonder there were only 3 other people there. came in here to escape the rain. drinks were strong and the bartender was great - good service and friendly. my boyfriend most definitely attracts the gay male population in portland as he got chatted up on the street numerous times, it's almost like we were attracted to this bar by divine intervention ;) I literally couldn't believe it..... Saturday of Portland Pride weekend, the place was packed, and the management had allotted ONE front of the house employee- the bartender!! \\n\\nI will never go back, because of their extremely poor showing on Pride. A gay bar? There's plenty better queer dives in this town. Horrible SERVICE! & Rude.... not personable at all... was frowned at and glared at while ordered food & i brought family in to eat and have a cocktail.. Gurllll.. shameful.. I am very very disappointed in this place! It's in a great location near CC Slaughters so you would think this place would have more business. This place could be great. Sadly the service suck! Specially the old bitch cranky bartender!  What is up with his diva attitude! He's chasing away customers and thanks to him business is going down for them! I would hope the owner would realize this place could be great with out crappy service! Just remember have a bad experience ill tell 10 people, have a great experience I will come back and bring people in! Your move! So my friend and I needed to use a bathroom bad! We popped in here and she went in while I waited my turn, the bartender came over and said \\\"we have 2 more bathrooms in back. He was so friendly we decided to sit at the bar and have a drink. I don't mind that the place was mostly a gay bar, even though we were obviously not. He was really nice and welcoming. I will definitely recommend The Fox and Hounds. Cute place and super chill. love it.  It's your total comfort food place if you ever need one.  It's a great queer place to hang out at as well.  Drinks are made strong, which is good!\\n\\nThe staff was great and the prices were pretty reasonable for the amount of food that you get!  Plus they are open super super late! A very low-key gay bar. Perfect environment for the gay community, but without the extremes. Good food, fair prices. I work right across the street from Fox & Hounds.  During the summer months when I go outside to eat my lunch I always see people from the company I work for go and eat at this establishment.  I often wondered why so many people went over there.  Is it a convenience factor?  Is the food really that good?  What gives?  Well, after all these years of working in this neighborhood I decided it was time to see what the deal was.  I took a colleague of mine out for lunch here and another gem was found.\\n\\nFirst off the food here is very affordable.  Most of their sandwiches are under $8.  This is not an $8 sandwich that you get at some of the sandwich shops in town that come with nothing and you laugh at how small it is.  This is a good sized sandwich that comes with a side (salad, fries, cup of soup?).  My colleague had heard that the Chicken Cordon Bleu ($7.25) sandwich was really good here.  That is what we both ended up ordering.  That and a few drinks (of the non-alcoholic variety as it was a work day) got me out the door for only $21.\\n\\nThe sandwich was very tasty.  The chicken was nice and moist and the bun that came along for the ride lasted throughout that ride.  I wanted to be a good boy and get a salad and was quite happy that it was pretty big.  Very good bang for your buck.\\n\\nFox & Hounds is also a bar that I believe caters mostly to the gay crowd.  Not that you have to be gay to come here.  I imagine it gets pretty lively here at nights and on weekends.  I know it as a place to get a sandwich or a burger that won't break the bank.  Now I know and knowing is half the battle. At first I thought this place looked like a spin off a rustic saloon, but then I realized it was just old and dirty. I've been here a couple times and (I hate to say it) ordered the same thing. Each time it looked completely different. Zero consistency. The bartenders are nice, but they go out for smoke breaks often and one of them had a \\\"shift drink\\\" (or shot, more like) during his shift. I see the potential, but definitely needs work. Good atmosphere and good priced drinks. Solid cheeseburger and french dip. My wife and I didn't even realize it was a gay bar until halfway through our meal. I'd go back for another french dip. It was late on a Friday night.  We were looking for a quiet place for an after-the-show get-together.  One of our friends highly recommended Fox & Hounds, stating something about the bartender always excited to them, so we took the small stroll over.\\nFrom the outside, it looked like the ambiance we were looking for.  Relaxed, pool tables in the corner for casual games, and a bat half filled with patrons.  The transition inside was not what I was expecting, which was the loud music which made things really difficult for me.  Everyone else seemed to be able to communicate just fine over the blaringly obviously iTunes playlist on shuffle that played on the speaker system; for me though, I just gave up taking part of any conversation and just wish the night would end and go home. Used to like this place. New owners, new name. The rainbow flag is gone. Using the restroom requires asking for a key attached to a ridiculously large tchatchke. The tchatchke was disgustingly filthy. Like using the restroom at a Texaco. I ordered the fish and chips. The menu said ling cod. I got frozen Atlantic cod. Major difference. The coleslaw was old enough to vote, it was rotten and translucent. My husband got the Cordon Bleu. He still smells like onions. ONIONS! The fries were ok, large steak fries but the ketchup was obviously married and I didn't want to play shigellosis roulette. A sports themed bar with shitty food is really the last thing Old town/Chinatown needs at this point. Especially one that ignores the neighborhood demographics. Good luck Second Ave Sports Bar, you're gonna need it. Giving this place 5 stars because there is a new owner that is working hard to make things better. It is worth coming down again to check out since I think most people have forgotten about this place. Menu has been slimmed down to a more manageable selection. Food service at this time is still a little slow to get out orders. This is a bit of a problem during the weekday lunch hour since most people downtown are on a schedule and need to get in and out and back to work.  I think after a few of the kinks and growing pains are worked out this will be a downtown hangout worth coming back to. Came in yesterday for a quick drink before catching the train to the airport. Quiet, local gay bar. I encountered a nice bartender who pointed me in the right direction to the train stop, so I'm kind of surprised by the negative Yelp reviews as I didn't experience anything remotely like what I've read. Very fun, good food, casual, just up the street from more touristy places. Friendly crowd and staff. Beautifully remodeled, nice and dimly lit with a warm and cozy atmosphere complemented with friendly and attitudeless service.   I find this place great for relaxing with a beer and a shot after work.  Far cry from yesteryear when the establishment was frequented by loud over weight, unattractive, tweakers/drunks with personalities equal to that of underwatered houseplants.  Good moderately priced menu.  I would frequent this place more often if the pool table was less than seventy-five cents per game......or even  free!! Ate here before and enjoyed it, returned recently and I gotta say putting a sticker on your menu saying \\\"due to mimimum wage increases everything on the menu is +$1\\\" is also saying \\\"I'd literally pay my workers less than this if the government would let me\\\" or \\\"I don't care about my employees, so they won't care about the quality of your food.\\\" \\nNever coming back and advising other to not eat here! This is a quiet, relaxing place.  I like that!  If you're looking for loud music and a raucous atmosphere, this isn't the place for you.  But it's a very pleasant place with reasonable prices on food and drink.  Just one word of advice..  if you order steak or prime rib, ask for it to be cooked rare.  They seem to overcook the beef here until it's dry and tasteless. I have had really bad experience here.. But I am updating my review based on my experience with a bartender named Matt... Really awsome... Visit the ba when he is around! This is a nice place to grab a sandwich and a draft beer. Gay friendly, but not all gay. We went on a monday (yesterday eve). It was Labor Day, not crowded at about 5:30pm. My first time there. I got the rueben sandwich and a salad (instead of fries). Salad was crisp and fresh, rueben was good but note that there is very little meat in the sandwich but it was still ok. It was $8 or $7.something.  A friend got the mac and cheese with bacon. A lot of food and very good, but a tad pricey at $9. The 3rd in our group got the Monday special: a small steak, baked potato, brocolli, and side salad all for $9,50. Very good deal. The service was VERY slow. The bartender was also the server. He was busy talking with the two guys sitting at the bar or going outside to smoke to give us any decent service. But who is in a rush? Glad we weren't. So don't get the rueben til they start putting more meat but the other meals, the atmosphere, all worth it. h and maybe don't go on mondays...get a different server that way. we had a rough week, and had been meaning to come here for some time. we came for lunch 12-22-12. began with a bloody mary, and a corona. next, i chose the veggie s. and m. burger on wheat with a salad and oil/vinegar. my partner had the traditional s. and m. burger with fries. the drinks hit the spot, and the food was delicious. our server/bartender was the best...he was so efficient, funny, friendly, and very customer-focused...we will be back...thx so much... Atmosphere here is great, there is a pool table for those that are interested.  My server was very friendly and funny. My only complaint (which is kinda silly), is the well vodka is foul.  I'm not a picky drinker and order well often, but I ordered a drink and a friend did also, both of us could barely choke it down.  Neither were made incorrectly... they were definitely what we ordered, but the vodka was a little odd... almost bitter.  I can't really fault the establishment though, because you can simply choose another brand of vodka; I would recommend they look into switching that out though and again, I'm really not picky with that stuff.  We will definitely be back! I have gone a couple of time in the past year to Fox & Hounds (little bar/food joint) because it is conveniently located near my job.  It's a dive but I continue to go.  Everytime I go the service is late.  This last time I went is the LAST time I will ever go!!!  Let me break it down for you...\\n\\nI walk in and the waiter (they only have one) looks me directly in the face as I walk myself to a booth.  He continues to take care of the table he is serving at the time.  He walks around the bar and walks behind the bar and gets their drinks ready.  He continues to go back to their table with their drinks and will not look at me...keep in mind I'm right behind him.  He walks back to give the cook their orders and then walks behind the bar to chitchat w/the barflies.  I'm staring him down the WHOLE time.  He then goes and gets their food from the cook area.  At that time I go and get my own menu!  I walk back to my booth and he's right behind me!!!  He serves that last table with their food and goes back behind the bar to chitchat.  Finally...20 minutes later he comes over as if nothing is wrong.  He has stupid smile on his face like he knows he should apologize!!!  But he doesn't!  By this time my date (fiance) had shown up and we order.  By the time we are get our food we eat a couple of bites and have to box it up and leave!  Never once did he apologize or anything.  I have, like I said, been to this place a couple of times and every time I feel like I don't get the service that I deserve!!! Cheap good food.  Besides just being across the street from work, the best part about going there is Jeff, the bartender.  LOVE him.  I've only been there for lunch during work, so I haven't tried any drinks, but the food is good for bar food. DO NOT GO HERE\\n\\n(To the owner, feel free to get in contact with us)\\n\\nseriously we used to be regulars and have gone to this bar for over a DECADE!\\n\\nThis is the last time we will ever go to this bar. \\nYou had many chances and disappointed our group every Sunday for the last couple months.\\n\\nIt's Sunday and we called around 2pm, told them a large group of us will be showing up again. (usually ends up being around 10-15 people, plus others who join us and some who leave during our regular meet-ups) They told us they would be open their POSTED HOURS.\\n\\n(That means you were supposed to be open until 11 every Sunday night)\\n\\n we got there and the lights were off and doors locked, it's now only 6:50pm.\\n\\nThe last time we all tried to meet here, (we meet every Sunday here around 7pm) they told us they were no longer serving food for the day because the grill kept catching fire. (Ok I guess)\\n\\nBut then we ordered fried food and eventually (after three orders of only being able to choose from french fries or tater tots, are you kidding me!?) they told us they were no longer doing fried food either!\\n\\nI'm more then sure at this point, as is the rest of the group, they just didn't want to make food.\\n\\nThey closed an hour and half EARLY last Sunday\\nAn hour early the Sunday prior. \\nAnd many times before that.\\n\\nI work in the service industry, I UNDERSTAND wanting to go home, however I suck it up since I chose the field and job. I work 50/60+ hours a week so I really really understand that. But as a manager who covers shifts and volunteers to close, no matter how slow it might get, I ALWAYS stay open. ALWAYS have everything stocked and KNOW my inventory!\\n\\nIF ITS ON THE MENU,  YOU SERVE IT. PERIOD.\\n\\nDONT LET YOUR KITCHEN STAFF COME UP TO THE FRONT OF THE BAR COMPLAINING THAT SOMEONE GOT THEM SWISHER SWEETS INSTEAD OF SOME OTHER CIGARETTES WHILE CURSING LOUDY IN FRONT OF YOUR GUESTS.\\n\\nHOLY MOLY LADY! GOSH HECKIE YOUR STAFF IS A JOKE. \\n\\nFrom one business owner to another. The biggest regret I had when I bought my restaurant was not letting go of staff members who kept dragging it down and had repeated customer service issues. (Everyone gets a second chance) Eventually I let them go and I actually saw a lot of my regulars returning to me. \\n\\nYou should probably let some people go and start covering shifts yourself. Who knows, you might get customers back. \\n\\nI hope other customers step up and complain so you know what the in the world is going on at your bar.\\n\\nGet your staff and your service back in order.\\n\\nYou have lost a large group of customers and although we will be open to talking about a bunch of issues, we will not be returning to this bar again. That's a minimum of 10+ people your staff has alienated. I always knew Fox & Hounds to be a gay dive bar on the level that the Dirty Duck was, so I never really gave it a chance.  Recently a colleague of mine said she loved to go there after work, which I found odd given how I just described the place.  But yesterday I found myself there for some pool and cheap drinks (Hot Toddies for $5.50) and a friendly crowd.   \\n\\nTo me it still seems apparently gay, but I guess I'm a little more in tune with the cues.  My straight colleagues still enjoy themselves, as it should be.  It doesn't feel divey or dirty at all, probably due to their recent remodel.  I know I'll be back here for drinks with co-workers and some good games of pool. F&H is an unassuming sexless gay bar, where they pour cheap, strong drinks, the regulars are hardcore drinkers and the decor and  lighting are atrocious (akin to a Shari's). Fried food, bad music,  tube TV's and video poker add to the ambiance. \\n\\nIn sum, it's too brightly lit,  the vibe is lackluster, the dicks are limp but the drinks ARE stiff.\\n\\nL'Chaim! I'm feeling nice so giving them three stars because things turned around in the last year for me here. I've often wondered what I need to do in order to get half decent service here. It's taken me nearly five years and they treat me better, but still, worse than Denny's.\\n\\nThanks for having such a big menu, there are some edible things on it, which is more than most gay places in this town. I've got stories though... Moldy fried food, and a taco with a raw corn tortilla? Imagine trying to eat that?\\n\\nI go there because my friends who have been around longer go there and they have more money, flirt with the staff and tip them big. I guess that's how it's done... Echoing what the previous reviewers said...total dive bar.  However,  I had a really great experience there and plan on going back when I come back to Portland.  The staff were all friendly and attentive, my drink did not stay empty long without one of the servers asking if I needed another (yes please!).  The drinks themeselves were strong and cheap (ahhh the way I like em!), the food was decent considering the dive-y-ness of the place, the music was fun and the patrons were also friendly and a lot of fun.  There were four of us in our party, and we escaped with plenty of drinks and nibbles for under $60.00, which was worth an additional star. I have been going to the Fox and Hound for over 20 years and always had a good time and ran into lots of friend.  WHAT HAPPENED!!!  Does not feel like a gay bar anymore and Friday nights are dead!  What happened to our friendly bartender- Joe.  Always had great service and a good time.  The last 2 Fridays were horrible!!!! Don't know if I will go back! I have been to the Fox and Hounds a few times and have never been disappointed. I am not a \\\"sit at the bar type a guy\\\" so all my experience comes from sitting at the normal tables. The food, drinks, and service has always been extremely good. As with any place, challenges do arise. However, the one time that it did, the staff was extremely apologetic and took care of the problem right away. As with all the other reviews, the place is beautiful and very inviting to all. Thank you, Fox and Hounds. I will definitely keep coming back. I went here to meet someone for brunch.  To my surprise it was pretty nice.  I had an omelet and coffee for $8.which is a really low price for what you get.\\n\\nThe waiter was a bit absent minded, but it kind of gave the place character.  \\n\\nThe place is a staple low cost place to eat for the local gay community.\\n\\nThis is located just one block from the Chinatown/downtown stop on the Red or Blue MAX light rail trains. Always a favorite place for a good, solid, simple weekend breakfast without the Portland brunch wait. Excellent service. Generous cocktails. Affordable. And, yes, it's a gay bar but we straights are made perfectly welcome. Super nice people. And yes, you may have to maneuver around a couple of street people, but that's Old Town Portland. All good! When I say we get around.. we get around.. ;) Stopped in here Friday night after we couldn't get into the other place we planned so we had to pass the place we were supposed to go and ended up in this place. Had a few drinks in here, the atmophere was nice and friendly. Had a great time just kicking back and having a few. While I would have liked to go dancing.. thats ok.. I can be just as at home in a place like this if not more. \\n\\nI love pursuing downtown when you don't have a car to worry about.. you just from place to place and then you figure out where to catch the max and go home! So much easier and you frequent lots of bars that way too. Just walk from one to the next.. no problem! Would go in here again. They really do look after thier customers! Fox & Hounds is one of those places that's set off from the main path and once you find it, you're glad it is. The atmosphere is pleasant even when it's filled with regulars. It's a great place to grab a beer or a bite and read a book or just be alone with your thoughts but it's also a great place to gather with friends. \\n\\nService is prompt and efficient and provided by a warm, friendly staff. I've never felt rushed here even when they're visibly busy. You're given the feeling that you are your servers' or bartenders' only customer and these days, that kind of service is a rare find. \\n\\nThe menu is descriptive and offers better than the average bar fare. Try the Mac n Cheese with bacon...creamy goodness served with your choice of soup or salad. Generous portions so anticipate taking half your meal home with you. \\n\\nDrinks are cheap and strong. I know what you're thinking, nuff said! This place sucks. I asked for shots for my friends and was told that the bartender didn't \\\"feel like making shots\\\" so we were only allowed beers. What kind of bar does that? He also told us that if we ended up at his bar, we were probably kicked out of a club nearby. Not true at all for our crew, but I guess that's the type of crowd this bar attracts...\\n\\nNo wonder this bar is huge and only has two people other than us on a Friday night. After my second offensive attempt to have a drink at CC's (see my review), I discovered this gem of a bar.  I can't recommend it enough.\\n\\nNice decor, super bartender's, hot looking AND friendly customers, and an above par drink.\\n\\nWhat more can you ask for? Havent been here in awhile. Found out its under new management. Prices are still low drinks are still good. New menu. New pool tables.Gotta love this place. Like with any gay bar in Portland, don't expect attentiveness on your first few visits - unless you are really cute. Bartenders are efficient, not unfriendly and pour a good drink. The beer taps are probably pretty average for Portland and likely will provide something palatable for discerning beer drinkers. \\n\\nIf you hang around the bar a bit you'll notice that the bartenders and some of the regular customers can get rather catty at times - particularly when the odd unknowing group of apparently straight people walk in the door. This can be off-putting or enjoyable depending on your tastes. However, it all seems pretty harmless and just in fun.\\n\\nThe menu is pretty comprehensive and VERY inexpensive. I have tried a few items on the menu and been impressed with the quality. The cook is really very good.  \\n\\nThe place is comfortable, there are several TVs. Don't expect to catch the latest sporting event though. Fine by me. \\n\\nIt really is a nice place to check out particularly with a group of friends. Grab a table if you are seeking a semi-private conversation. Sit at the bar if you enjoy eaves-dropping on (or participating in) the cattiness. Fox & Hounds has been a starting place, mid-party rehydration station, and last stop to some of my best evenings in Portland.  The place is dark and divy, but the staff are always friendly and cheerful.  They make a STRONG long island which is a necessity on any night out in Portland.  It is within walking distance to events like Blow Pony and places like CC Slaughters and Whiskey Bar.  In the middle of the night when you and your friends need a mini break from the party, another drink, and a clean bathroom, go to Fox & Hounds.  Pull up a chair, share a drink, and get a little quality chat time in with your friends before rejoining the party. If you want a place to dine that is fabulous in all areas, make your way to Fox And Hounds.  Great food and fabulous people. Wow!!!!! I posted some photos of Rick and Jeff. These guys make a restaurant experience memorable  Thanks Rick for the awesome service Can't believe the service tonight.  Girl behind the bar seemed off possibly on something or had been drinking.  It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to to get a drink or bottle of beer. We usually come in on Saturday nights and the bartender who has worked there for years and should be experienced is slow and more interested in idle chit chat than serving customers! Leaving won't be back! First time here, and my last. Sat at the bar, and was forced to witness the drunken owner verbally abuse and humiliate his staff in front of a a bar full of customers. As a customer service business owner myself, I was shocked to see an owner behave this way. I heard from a regular customer seated next to me that this happens often here, and that they can't keep staff as a result. I'm surprised this place hasn't been busted by the OLCC since the owner is drunk while on the premises. The food was good, though, and the staff did their best, given who they have to work for. This place has solid food and the the new owner is proactive to to say the least. and I know they've been going through a lot of changes. I've worked in the industry long enough to know things get weird and unpredictable. It's a good bar don't bitch about food issues. If you can't afford a nice brunch or steak at real restaurant that doesn't those things don't bitch about the BAR you are sitting in. Have a drink chill out...Jim... maybe have a more understanding humble point of view...coming from a church goer.\",\n          \"Beer menu is limited but decent, food items are fresh and delicious. Ambient is comfy and spacious, prices are OK for the area. Great FL Beer selection. Friendly bar service and nice fresh vegetables to go. I like this place a lot! We have had beer so many times from here. But honestly we get wine and charceuterie from la femme de Fromage. Unfortunately they disappointed us so we sat at Florida and co. Wonderful experience with perky staff (Jennifer) and good alternative food option from houndstooth The food is amazing. The drinks are great craft brews and mimosas. The environment is chill and relaxing! Great place Friendly staff, locally grown and produced products, craft beer and even personal hygiene products... What more can you ask for? Cute bar too! Nice little local hotspot inside East End Market just as you enter. The beautiful natural wood counter invites their customers in to their bar stool seating. The staff are welcoming and knowledgeable on their only local ingredients menu. To be honest, we only came for the drinks menu, but they do serve what looks to be delicious food.\\nMy other half ordered their very affordable beer flight, which included 5 beer samples for just $10! I on the other hand orders their Shrub which is a flavored vinegar with sparking wine or water. Let's just say he got the better end of the deal. Even though their options for beer are limited on draft, the options were tasty. As for me, I should've just stuck with me gut and gotten wine. The Bees Knees with sparkling water was boring. It tasted like just like water at first then a sour honey at the end. I gave it another try with their Mayhaw Berry option, which wasn't any better. To tart for my taste unfortunately.\\nNeedless to say I'm sure we will be back for their beer flight again and just avoid the Shrubs and order their food the next go around. Shout out to Florida & Co for repping the sunshine state HARD! From locally sourced ingredients, to brews from all over our lovely state- this spot is showcasing the flavors of all the fun under the Florida sun.\\n\\nDavid was awesome - and helped to prepare a great Beer Flight for me. From stouts to ciders, I got a chance to try 5 different beers. My two favorites were the Apple Cider from Keel and Curly as well as the Key Lime Beer from Key Billy. \\n\\nI also had a chance to try the Shrimp and Grits my momma ordered. This was as hearty as you'd expect a shrimp and grits to be, but not as decadent as your traditional southern preparation. \\n\\nMade with coconut oil instead of butter, the bowl of grits was topped with hearty portions of shrimp, greens, peppers and onions. It was so flavorful and almost too pretty to eat!\\n\\nThis spot has high top tables and a good amount of bar seating, but they'll also bring your food outside if you decide to dine al fresco.\\n\\nThey've also got a good selection of wines - even some wine on tap! They offer flights of wine as well which is fun. We discovered this little gem while waiting to  get into Domu. We took the server's suggestion, ordered a beer off their featured list and got the small plate Red Snapper Ceviche w/ plaintain chips (idk why it says chips, they were delicious, juicy and thick like normal fried plantains). I thought the ceviche was kind of sharp/acidic but my boyfriend loved it. Definitely recommend the ceviche on top of the plaintain to cancel out some of the acidity (even if it is a bit hard to scoop).\\n\\nCant wait to visit again! : ) A place you can buy local groceries and drink local beer and wine too?! What a unique concept!\\n\\nI haven't drank here yet, but I am very familiar with many of the brews they have on tap and sold as bottles. They are all high quality craft beers, all of which look to be brewed right here in Florida. One side of their grocery counter acts as a bar, where about 5 people can sit and enjoy their beer. You'll also see people sitting outside drinking too.\\n\\nSo far I have only bought a dozen eggs here, picked locally, for $4 a dozen. These are the same eggs you might have seen at the Audubon Park Farmers market. Browsing through their selection, they also have all local arugula, lettuces, heirloom tomatoes, squashes, and frozen meats. Plus spices and bottles of vanilla.\\n\\nI'm looking forward to having a cold local beer here one of these days. Went for the first time two days ago and was extremely impressed!  The pesto meatballs over zucchini \\\"pasta\\\" was fabulous as well as the ceviche, which was equally good.  It was great to be able to drink a grapefruit mimosa with fresh grapefruit pulp in it.  Yummy.  The decor and ambiance was steller!  I highly recommend. Great beer election, very helpful staff. They also have a variety of different products ranging from produce to beard cleanser to vanilla extracts. If you are in Orlando, you absolutely must visit the East End Market and stop by Local Roots. Love east end market overall as a whole but the service at Florida & Co beer was not good at all. We sat,  the guy working took several minutes just to greet us and when he did it wasn't friendly..as if we were a bother. There were only 2 other patrons and he engaged them 100% of the time, non-stop talking  about himself and his plans.  Very disappointing as I'm a local and visit this place often. One should engage, conversation with all customers,  be friendly to all. Thankfully there are other great local shops here with excellent customer service! Florida & Co. is the first place (on the left) when you walk in the front entrance at East End Market.  It used to be called Local Roots, but has been going through a branding change.  My husband and I ordered brunch from  Farm Haus (at the back left of East End) and then sauntered over to the bar at Florida & Co.\\n\\nWe were quickly greeted by two staff members that saw us eyeing their draft menu.  They provided recommendations based on the types of beers we like and my husband and I both ended up with drafts that we enjoyed.  The staff said that we could sit at their counter and eat/drink or we could wander around East End Market with our beers, no need to feel stuck there.  As we were waiting on our food to be ready, we took a seat at the bar there, and remained there eating once we got our food.\\n\\nThe offer locally sourced items such as meat, beer, body products, and honey.  Some of the items seemed a bit pricey to me, but others were what I expected at any market or grocery store.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly and chatty with those the customers that were also chatty.  Overall, a great first beer at Florida & Co.  I'm sure we will continue to check out what they have on tap during our visits to the Market. This is an awesome place to find Florida local items. I love shopping small and shopping local, and this place kills two birds with one stone, as it were. They have everything from local craft beers to t-shirts that let you showcase your local love with a great shirt!\\n\\nI'll be headed back to snatch up the honey butter in the cold case. Couldn't take it on my last visit since I wasn't headed home, and it needs to be kept cool.\\n\\nThe staff greeted my sister and I right away and offered help on anything we wanted more info on. I also fell in love with the local roots t-shirt that had the Orlando city skyline on it. \\n\\nOverall: A\\nThis place rocks. I love local stuff and this place has it all! Amazing first experience. Ordered the Southern spicy with Florida white shrimp with a soft egg. Was extremely delicious, I was licking the bowl. Had the right balance of citrus and spice! What can I say it was delicious. Located at the front of the East End Market, Local Roots Farm Store offers a nice selection of items. Greens, veggies, farm fresh eggs, meats and nice locally made pantry items like Mannix Vanilla, grits and home and bath products. \\n\\nThe beautiful wood bar offers up a nice spot to enjoy Quantum Leap wines and Florida brewed craft beers. (Including Cask & Larder) Try a flight and sample your way through some great wines or craft brews. Local Roots offers wifi and a spot to sit down to enjoy your delicious sandwich from Hounds Tooth or maybe La Bretxa. Service is attentive and warm, if you prefer to soak up the beautiful Florida day, it's OK to take your glassware outside to the picnic tables or enjoy the courtyard. I love East End Market and Local Roots is one of the tenant merchants that help cement that love! This is the store that helps make EEM a market. I am able to stop by, pick up some bread, local meat, eggs, and a bottle of something fun!\\n\\nAs previous reviews have mentioned, LR has a fabulous wooden counter that you can sit at while sipping on local wine and beer (sometimes they even have rare brews!). I've also sat there having a coffee from Lineage when EEM was fairly empty and they had no problem with this. \\n\\nThey carry various seasonal greens, local organic meat & poultry, eggs ($4/dozen~ I can dig those prices!), locally-made greeting cards, lotions & elixirs, etc. I always get my eggs here now since they are so cheap and who can beat local, free-range eggs? No one. That's who.\\n\\nBut what always keeps me coming back is the service (isn't it  always that?). The person behind the counter is always incredibly nice and always seems genuinely interested in the customer. Last time I was there I bought some eggs, mentioned that they were for my sister's after-wedding brunch, and the woman gushed to my sister and wished her so much happiness and love. It was so nice and more than just a quick 'congrats.' \\n\\ntl;dr - Great eggs, great service = 5 stars Great selection of local and regional beers on tap and they have a sampler platter my favorite! The good service others rave about was absent during my recent weekend morning visit. A buddy and I sat down to eat food from the bakery across the hall - it was already 82 degrees at 11 a.m. and we didn't want to eat outside. \\n\\nThe Local Roots \\\"bartender\\\" said he only had beer and wine. No cold non-alcoholic drinks. He filled a pitcher with warm tap water (no ice), poured us each a glass and then put the pitcher out of reach. We downed the waters quickly - we'd been out biking - and started at our empty glasses while he spent five minutes counting coins in his coin box.\\n\\nNot wanting to be a pain I waited a while before getting up, walking over, and asking for a refill. He obliged - and then put the warm water pitcher out of reach again before walking off to adjust the twine holding the price tag to the kale basket at the back of the store. Same thing again, staring at empty glasses. There were 0-2 other customers in the store this whole time. \\n\\nI understand that we were not paying customers, but the bartender lost a chance to build goodwill and attract a future customer that would evangelize for a business that looks like it needs all the evangelism it can get. What would I have done in his shoes?\\n\\n- Poured the pitcher and then left it for us to \\\"self serve,\\\" freeing him to other duties\\n\\n- Gotten ice for the pitcher without putting the customer in the awkward position of being the 'I am only here drinking free water, and now you're asking me if you should walk across the building on my account for some ice' guy\\n\\n- Poured a couple little taster glasses of beer and slipped them in front of us unbidden. If we turn them down, the bartender just wasted 50 cents of product. If we drink them, he's got customers for life. (\\\"Hey! I'm that bartender's best friend! He just gave me a free beer!) Local Roots, you better clear out a permanent stool at your bar for me. I love your variety of all things Florida. From carrying local beers and wines to handmade hards and deli items. Aside from the eye catching wooden bar, the unique wooden taps truly draw a passerby's attention in. While we were a bit disappointed that we couldn't score a space at the bar to enjoy our Original Sin Pear Cider, we were more than happy to get some vitamin D with our brew at one of the outdoor picnic tables. \\n\\nI could reiterate all the positive things that the reviewers before me touched upon, but what stood out in my mind is the supremely chill vibe given off by the gents running the counter. They were helpful and very efficient despite every seat being taken at the bar. I loved the homemade feeling of everything, like I was welcomed at the counter in their personal kitchen. The chalkboard with the tap listing was a bit small, but it was effective in drawing us up to the counter to take a closer look. \\n\\nI hope I can time my next visit better, so I can pick the brains of the staff and learn more about their business. Those visiting EEM, make this a pitstop on your list whether you're buying a beverage or finding something deliciously local to take home with you. We fancied ourselves a beer while munching on our grilled cheese from La Femme du Fromage (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-femme-du-fromage-orlando?hrid=6G5cYcOnpwibl63Eib6mCA) and Local Roots was able to fill that need. With local beers on tap & the option to get a flight we were able to taste several beers from around the Sunshine State. \\n\\nLoved the wooden bar! Such a cool design. While we didn't purchase anything on this visit, I did love perusing the wares of the shop and thinking about what I might need to pick up next time. If I lived around the corner in the neighborhood, this would be the perfect place to stop to pick up something for dinner. \\n\\nThe gentleman behind the bar was super friendly and didn't rush us in any way even as the crowd started to pick up around lunch time. There's plenty of seating (~15 stools) at the bar so you shouldn't have too hard a time finding a place to sit. Absolutely love this cute and local vendor at East End Market! Florida & Co. serves local craft beers as well as wine and sparkling cocktails. I'm excited to try their food menu next. Apparently you get 25% off your tab when you eat dinner here, even alcohol. Do yourself a favor and try the shrubs. It sounds weird, but they are so good. They are more of an elixir that they mix with sparkling soda or champagne. I loved the hibiscus and Mayhan the best. And if you're looking to try a different wine or beer offered, go for the flights. They are a great deal. You can bring your drinks around the market or even go outside and listen to the live band that might be there. Or just sit at the bar and enjoy some friendly conversation with Emily and Perrin. One of my favorite dishes is shrimp & grits.  The dish as prepared  by Florida & Co offers a delicious healthier option to the traditional southern dish.  Not the less in flavor, it is prepared with coconut oil and adds Swiss chard and kale along with savory shrimp and an egg on top. The ingredients are locally sourced and are fresh   It is a dish worth repeating.  The setting is so nice. You can eat outside or inside at counter seating. They serve wine and also some craft beers on draft. I Can't wait for the next time I'm visiting the area to stop in at East end Market to try it again. Florida & Co is so good it will change your mind about Orlando. It proves it's more than a city just centered around touristy Disney World and full of gross, fried food. WRONG! \\n\\nFlorida & Co is a locally sourced restaurant inside the cool East End Market that prioritizes low sugar foods. On top of that, they sell some of Florida's best craft beer and ciders.\\n\\nI ordered the Mojo bowl or lunch with brown rice, kale, sweet peppers, orange slices, and Florida wild shrimp. It was all steamed and came with a light lime garlic sauce. It was so good, healthy, and balanced the flavors well (the orange slices were perfect and, yes, you are meant to eat the orange peel).\\n\\nThe drink list is really good and they always have a local cider on tap. I ordered the acai cider from Accomplice Brewery and it was one of the best drinks I've ever had.\\n\\nOn top of that, the space is beautiful with a few tables off to the side and a long wood bar to sit at. Also, the service is excellent and friendly! Claim to be a small craft brewery specialist, doesn't even know the difference between white IPA and a pale ale... food is pretty good but owner is incompetent, decent experience but made it hard to enjoy a beer due to bad attitude. Stick too food here This place is a wonderful staple in the East end market. The last few times I've been here have been as a layover type visit- while waiting on a table at Domu or just for cheese (from the fromage) and beer but I need to change that as their menu has expanded and looks rather tasty AND healthy. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the local craft beers they have and are always willing to let you sample something before you decide. The bar front seating can be limited but they are more than willing to let you sit outside with drinks and will deliver food to you outside as well. I came here a few weekends ago with friends and it was so amazing! It's located inside East End Market so a great place to hangout on a Saturday or Sunday morning. They have ample seating space, extremely friendly employees, and a menu full of feel-good, delicious meals and snacks. I ordered the Florida Bowl with Shrimp. It did take a few minutes to prepare, but I was the first customer of the morning and they prepared everything fresh which was nice. The bowl began with a bed of rice, a hearty portion of greens, ample pickled vegetables, and a deliciously light cilantro-lemongrass sauce. Four or five large shrimp adorned the top of the bowl. \\n\\nI absolutely loved this! First of all, it was piping hot and extra comforting on a rainy morning. At $15 a bowl, you really get a perfect sized portion-- enough to feel like you've got your money's worth, but not simply loaded with cheap fillers. The cilantro-lemongrass sauce was truly a standout. A lot of times I order things with sauce on the side because they're too often heavy handed in the application, or way too oily. There was just the right amount of sauce added to this bowl and it wasn't loaded down with weird oils. Absolutely wonderful-- highly recommend! I was really excited to come to this place to try some ceviche. I'm not sure if it was the advertising , but it looks delicious. Surely enough it was. However their is always more then one aspect to a dining experience! Let's take it from the top! \\n\\nI'd like to start with the parking. Which you have to acknowledge as lackluster. It is understandable, for a market that shares space with several different kinds of businesses. However, space is available right outside of East End as it does tend to fill up quickly and for many hours on end. All within a short walking distance and free. No worries! \\n\\nFlorida and Co is located right up front on your left as soon as you enter. The aesthetic immediately captures your attention and if seafood is your thing, then it will also captures your tastebuds. Upon seating ourselves and reviewing the menus. We ordered 2 waters which were filled a quarter full each time (including the one refill). I'm not sure if that is part of the experience or not. No big deal, I finally settled upon ordering the ceviche bowl and anxiously awaited as I contained my growling stomach! \\n\\nMy favorite time arrived as I received my food within minutes and was extremely excited to eat this meal. I went with the jasmine rice option as well and really hoped for a nice heaping bowl of ceviche for $15. To my dismay, I received the bowl, minus the heaping. It turned out to be enough food for about half the actual size of the bowl. In all fairness, the food was absolutely delicious. The fish was very fresh and the acidity and lime really work well together in the ceviche. The onions are proportionate and the jasmine rice is to die for. \\n\\nA restaurant is much more than a food establishment though, it is at its heart. A service based business. I would like to mention Kristen as a very nice and helpful employee. I say this because Kristen turned out to be the only one their that morning who actually put on a nice friendly smile and sought to uphold the customer service standard. Aside from that, I must note that the service in general was bad. After paying for my purchase and putting the tablet on the table for my girlfriend to pay for her meal, the  employee across from us snatched the tablet and gives it to a couple next to me, forcing us to awkwardly wait for someone to check out before us in the middle of us checking out. That was really uncomfortable for me. I still left a tip because I appreciate the hard work small business go through and just want to show my support in anyway possible. \\n\\n\\nOverall, the food is good here. I don't warn anyone against going here. If ceviche or seafood is your thing, you might want to go for it. As for me, Unfortunately, I will not be back, but I do have high hopes for the future of this business! Their food is just amazing. Have you ever had the first bite of something and literally say \\\"OH MY GOD\\\" this is so good and just be in  over it? Lol yeah this places does that to me every time. Everyone who works there is also super nice and helpful. Love love love. If you haven't tried it you MUST! Every time I hit up East End, I always go to Gideon's and Domu. But this time I finally gave the other spots a try, which led me to the zucchini noodle bowl at Florida & Co. they're clearly capitalizing on the fad diets of New Years Resolutions, which is fine by me! The zucchini was crunchy and it soaked up that great pecan pesto sauce. Topped it with their homemade meatballs and red sauce, and I was in heaven. The bowl packed flavor and savor and it satisfied my pasta needs. We came here for another establishment but on our way out of this indoor farmers market type place we made a pit stop. My husband tried a sample of the Central 28, Upriver American Pale Ale 6%. He enjoyed it so much he went ahead and got a glass for $7.00. \\n\\nI will say their beer pairs well with Gideons cookies. 5 Stars for all of the reasons mentioned in my prior review and now some fabulous prepared food!\\n\\nThere's still the local beers, locally made products, and tasty wines, but what was once Local Roots is now Florida & Co., and it provides another great option for prepared food at East End Market.\\n\\nI took a seat at one of their round high top tables and ordered the (local meat) meatball sandwich and a rice bowl of pickled veggies, lettuce, and shrimp. Of course, I forgot to take a picture of the menu, so I don't have the official names of these dishes, but it seems like anything you order off this menu is going to be quality and full of flavor.\\n\\nThe meatball sandwich was hearty and had enough acidity to leave you feeling light afterwards. Which is the first time I can remember feeling that after a meatball sub. The rice bowl had thinly sliced pickled cucumbers, carrots, and beautiful lettuce leaves (I want to say butter lettuce, but I'm not great at identifying greens...). But the star of the dish was the shrimp. There were plenty of perfectly seasoned shrimp (no poop vein!) and a bite of pickled vegetables with shrimp is flavor perfection!\\n\\nService was great (thanks, David!) and the round tables gave more privacy for lunch meetings than when you used to only have the bar as an option. There's not as much selection in terms of produce or local gifts, but that's been replaced with really, really good food. So, overall, a great change!\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1075,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
